## Pre-Migration Checklist

Complete these items before starting your migration:

### Backups
- [ ] Complete file system backup of your Magento installation
- [ ] Database backup (use the command in Step 1 below)
- [ ] Media files backup (`pub/media` directory)
- [ ] Custom configuration files backup (`.env`, `app/etc/env.php`)

### Environment Requirements
- [ ] SSH/command-line access to your server
- [ ] Composer 2.8+ installed (`composer --version` to verify)
- [ ] Sufficient disk space (at least 2x your current installation size for backups)
- [ ] Current Magento version is 2.4.6 or later

### Recommended Preparations
- [ ] Review third-party extension documentation for any known issues
- [ ] Notify your team about the planned migration window
- [ ] Prepare a staging environment for testing (recommended for production sites)

> **Tip:** If your Magento version is older than the latest version, we strongly suggest you update to the latest Magento Open Source version first, then migrate to Mage-OS.

## Migration Process

### Step 1: Create Backup

```bash
# Backup database
mysqldump -u username -p database_name > backup.sql

# Backup files
tar -czvf magento-backup.tar.gz /path/to/magento
```

### Step 2: Switch to Mage-OS Repository

```bash
cd /path/to/your/magento

# Add Mage-OS repository
composer config repositories.0 composer https://repo.mage-os.org/

# Require Mage-OS product
composer require mage-os/product-community-edition --no-update

# Remove Magento product
composer remove magento/product-community-edition \
  magento/composer-dependency-version-audit-plugin \
  magento/composer-root-update-plugin --no-update

# Update all dependencies
composer update --no-plugins --with-all-dependencies
```

### Step 3: Run Upgrade

```bash
# Run setup upgrade
bin/magento setup:upgrade

# Compile DI
bin/magento setup:di:compile

# Deploy static content
bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy -f

# Reindex
bin/magento indexer:reindex

# Flush cache
bin/magento cache:flush
```

### Step 4: Verify Installation

```bash
# Check version
bin/magento --version

# Should output: Mage-OS 2.x.x
```

- Custom CLI commands

> **Important:** Mage-OS uses the same codebase structure as Magento Open Source.

## Migration Process

For production environments, use a staged approach:

### 1. Clone Environment

```bash
# Clone your production to a staging environment
rsync -avz production/ staging/
```

### 2. Test Migration on Staging

Perform the migration on staging first and thoroughly test:

- Checkout flow
- Admin panel functionality
- Third-party integrations
- Custom functionality

### 3. Schedule Maintenance Window

For the final switchover:

1. Enable maintenance mode
2. Sync any database changes
3. Perform migration
4. Test critical paths
5. Disable maintenance mode

---

## Rollback Procedure

If issues arise, you can rollback:

```bash
# Restore database
mysql -u username -p database_name < backup.sql

# Restore files
tar -xzvf magento-backup.tar.gz -C /
```

To switch back to Magento repositories:

```bash
composer config repositories.0 composer https://repo.magento.com/
composer require magento/product-community-edition --no-update
composer remove mage-os/product-community-edition --no-update
composer update --no-plugins --with-all-dependencies
bin/magento setup:upgrade
```
