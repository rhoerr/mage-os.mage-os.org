## Web Server

### Apache

| Requirement              | Value             |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Version                  | 2.4+              |
| Required modules         | `mod_rewrite`     |
| Configuration            | `.htaccess` support enabled |

### nginx

| Requirement              | Value             |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Version                  | 1.24+ (1.26 recommended) |
| Configuration            | Custom rewrite rules required |

Choose one web server. nginx generally offers better performance at scale, while Apache provides easier configuration via `.htaccess` files.

---

## PHP Requirements

### Supported Versions

| Version | Status                           |
| ------- | -------------------------------- |
| PHP 8.4 | Recommended (latest features)    |
| PHP 8.3 | Supported (proven stability)     |

### Required Extensions

```
bcmath, ctype, curl, dom, fileinfo, gd, hash, iconv, intl,
json, libxml, mbstring, openssl, pcre, pdo_mysql, simplexml,
soap, sockets, sodium, xml, xsl, zip, zlib
```

Verify extensions with: `php -m | grep -i <extension_name>`

---

## Database

### Supported Databases

| Database | Minimum Version | Recommended | Notes                          |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| MySQL    | 8.0             | 8.4         | Oracle's official distribution |
| MariaDB  | 10.6            | 11.4        | Popular MySQL alternative      |
| Percona  | 8.0             | 8.0         | Enterprise MySQL variant       |

Choose one database server. MariaDB and MySQL are the most common choices for Mage-OS deployments.

### Database Settings

Recommended `my.cnf` or `my.ini` configuration:

```ini
[mysqld]
# Buffer pool: Set to 50-70% of available RAM for dedicated DB servers
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 1G

# Log file size: Larger values improve write performance
innodb_log_file_size = 256M

# Packet size: Required for large imports
max_allowed_packet = 64M

# Temp tables: Prevents disk-based temp tables for most queries
tmp_table_size = 64M
max_heap_table_size = 64M

# Connection settings
max_connections = 150
wait_timeout = 28800
```

For production servers with 8GB+ RAM, increase `innodb_buffer_pool_size` to 4G or higher.

---

## Search Engine

A search engine is **required** for Mage-OS. It powers catalog search, layered navigation, and admin grids.

### Supported Search Engines

| Engine        | Minimum Version | Recommended | Notes                              |
| ------------- | --------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| OpenSearch    | 2.5             | 2.19        | Recommended (open source, active)  |
| Elasticsearch | 7.17            | 8.x         | Requires license for some features |

OpenSearch is recommended for new installations as it is fully open source and actively maintained by the community.

### Memory Requirements

| Environment  | Heap Size | Notes                         |
| ------------ | --------- | ----------------------------- |
| Development  | 1GB       | Suitable for small catalogs   |
| Staging      | 2GB       | Mirrors production            |
| Production   | 4GB+      | Scale based on catalog size   |

Set heap size via `ES_JAVA_OPTS` or `OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS`:

```bash
export OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS="-Xms4g -Xmx4g"
```

---

## Cache and Sessions

### Redis / Valkey (Recommended)

Redis or Valkey provides high-performance caching for sessions, page cache, and the application cache backend.

| Software | Minimum Version | Recommended | Notes                         |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| Valkey   | 7.0             | 8.0         | Open source Redis fork        |
| Redis    | 7.0             | 7.2+        | Industry standard             |

Valkey is recommended for new installations as an open source Redis alternative.

### Varnish (Production)

Varnish is a full-page cache that dramatically improves frontend performance. While optional for development, it is recommended for production.

| Version | Status      | Notes                     |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| 7.6     | Recommended | Latest stable             |
| 7.x     | Supported   | All 7.x versions work     |

---

## Message Queue

### RabbitMQ (Optional)

RabbitMQ enables asynchronous processing of bulk operations, inventory updates, and order processing. It is optional for small stores but recommended for high-traffic sites.

| Version | Status      | Notes                     |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| 4.0     | Recommended | Latest stable             |
| 3.12+   | Supported   | Minimum supported version |

---

## Composer

Composer is required for installing and updating Mage-OS.

| Requirement   | Value    |
| ------------- | -------- |
| Version       | 2.7+ (2.8 recommended) |
| PHP memory    | 1GB+ available during installation |
| Disk space    | 500MB+ for cache |

Verify your version with: `composer --version`

---

## Disk Space

| Purpose          | Minimum | Recommended | Notes                              |
| ---------------- | ------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Application      | 5GB     | 10GB        | Includes vendor directory          |
| Database         | 10GB    | 50GB+       | Scales with catalog and orders     |
| Media files      | Varies  | Varies      | Product images, PDFs, downloads    |
| Logs             | 5GB     | 10GB        | Rotate logs to manage disk usage   |
| **Total Server** | 30GB    | 80GB+       | SSD storage recommended            |

Use SSD storage for optimal performance. NVMe drives provide the best results for database and search engine workloads.

---

## Server Hardware

### Minimum Requirements

| Resource | Development | Production (Small) | Production (Large) |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| CPU      | 2 cores     | 4 cores            | 8+ cores           |
| RAM      | 4GB         | 8GB                | 16GB+              |
| Storage  | 30GB SSD    | 50GB SSD           | 100GB+ NVMe        |

These are baseline requirements. Actual needs depend on catalog size, traffic volume, and customizations.
