## Value Proposition

### What is the purpose of Mage-OS?

We want businesses and careers built around Magento Open Source to prosper.

Magento Open Source is a mature eCommerce platform, with more than 300,000 developers and thousands of businesses worldwide depending on it.

We are ensuring a bright future for Magento by enabling the development community to enhance the platform, providing merchants and agencies the long-term reliability they require, and giving newcomers an easy entry into the platform.

### How will Mage-OS fulfill its purpose?

Mage-OS is an eCommerce platform, evolved from Magento Open Source. It can be used to build online stores, in the same way that Magento Open Source can be used.

Because Mage-OS is focused on improving the components that make up the platform, we envision it becoming a foundation that many purpose-built variations of eCommerce systems can be built on—for example, a minimal system optimized for low resource consumption, or a system optimized for headless storefronts, or for modern server-side rendered stores.

We are also driving the ecosystem by providing content for merchants and agencies, including comparisons to other platforms, showcases, FAQs, directories, and more.

### How is Mage-OS better than Magento Open Source?

Our initial focus is on significant performance and usability improvements. We integrate changes that have been suggested as Pull Requests to Magento Open Source by the community, but haven't been included by Adobe.

Over time, those bug fixes and improvements will become an increasingly large advantage for Mage-OS over Magento.

### Why should a merchant consider using Mage-OS?

Mage-OS offers:

- A mature and stable platform with a huge amount of existing third-party integrations
- Ownership of the platform by being able to become a member of the Mage-OS Association
- Unparalleled flexibility and customizability
- A large global community of developers, agencies, and support

### As an agency, what value do I get from Mage-OS?

- Direct influence and ownership of the platform by becoming a member
- A stable and mature eCommerce platform, evolved from Magento Open Source
- Participation in the vibrant global Magento community

## Vision and Sustainability

### What is the long-term vision?

Our vision for Mage-OS is to provide a high-quality, dependable, and better alternative to the Adobe-curated Magento Open Source project. We will demonstrate an ability to process contributions quickly and effectively, improve the quality and accessibility of the platform, and release updates on a regular cadence.

### What is the current status of Mage-OS?

Mage-OS initiatives include:

- **The Mage-OS Distribution**, available and usable today
- **Public Magento Mirror** composer repositories
- **Nightly development builds**, available by composer
- **Public Mage-OS and Magento Developer Documentation** ([devdocs.mage-os.org](https://devdocs.mage-os.org/))
- Open source tooling to create a Magento mirror or new release from GitHub sources
- Open source **GitHub Actions** for testing and validation
- **Local communities** to engage and grow the ecosystem

The Mage-OS Distribution is open for contributions and pull requests at [github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2).

### When can I start using Mage-OS?

You can use Mage-OS today! See the [Get Started](/get-started) page for instructions.

### What are the plans for if Adobe no longer supports Magento Open Source?

If or when Adobe stops supporting Magento Open Source, Mage-OS will be well positioned to step into its place. This is an important aspect of Mage-OS: to provide certainty and a long-term plan for the ecosystem, regardless of factors outside our control.

In the meantime, we make every effort to preserve compatibility with Magento Open Source, while improving performance and adding new features.

### How is Mage-OS going to ensure long-term support?

We follow an approach inspired by the Typo3 Association. This model of a community-owned organization provides the vendor-based support and financial backing required for the long-term success of businesses built around Mage-OS.

## Finances

### How is the Mage-OS Association funded?

Mage-OS is fully funded by membership fees and donations from our members and partner companies. All payments are visible through our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/mage-os).

### How are funds used?

The Mage-OS Association is not-for-profit, and invests funds into:

- **Operational expenses:** Accountant, lawyer, bank fees, website, software and licenses
- **Staffing:** Part-time staff to organize contributors and efforts
- **Development:** Funding development of features and improvements to support ecosystem growth

### What protections are in place?

As a legally registered association, we are bound by our [statutes](/about/statutes), which include multiple approvals for all spending, audits by our Business Control Committee, and an annual budget and financials approved by the members.

### Can I pay for a feature?

Yes! If you would like to see a feature developed and are willing to put funds toward it, talk to us about the Mage-OS grant program. All grants are subject to applicability to the broad community and feasibility of completion.

## Community

### How is Mage-OS related to the Magento Association?

Mage-OS and the Magento Association both deal with the Magento ecosystem, but focus on different things.

**Magento Association** focuses on community events, content, outreach, and representing the Magento brand with Adobe.

**Mage-OS Association** is more technology-focused—we publish an improved but compatible distribution of Magento and focus on growing independently of Adobe.

We look forward to collaborating with the Magento Association as we both share the same fundamental purpose of supporting the Magento Open Source ecosystem.

### Why create a whole new association and brand?

We fundamentally disagree with the direction Adobe is taking the platform. In order to take the steps we see as necessary for Magento to thrive, we need control and nimbleness that is not possible in the Adobe-controlled Magento Open Source project.

For this reason, we made the decision to create our own fork and distribution based on the Magento open source code. The Magento name and logo are trademarks we can't use, so we call this new product Mage-OS.

### Is Mage-OS specific to Europe?

No. Mage-OS was started by a group of companies located mostly in Europe, but we are actively growing our member base all over the world.

### Isn't it a conflict of interest to have companies represented by leadership?

Any people with a business that relies on Magento have a vested interest in Magento's success. The Mage-OS Association's [statutes](/about/statutes) have specific requirements for avoiding direct conflicts of interest, which all board members must abide by.

## Usage

### Can I switch to Mage-OS if I'm already running Magento?

Yes! You will need to make some changes to your composer.json file and then update. The Mage-OS mirror is compatible with all your existing Magento code, but please test in a development environment before switching on a live site.

### Can I switch back to Magento after using Mage-OS?

Yes! You can switch back by updating your composer.json file. You will lose any Mage-OS specific enhancements in the process.

### Can I move from Mage-OS to Adobe Commerce?

Yes. It is very similar to moving from Magento Open Source to Adobe Commerce. You'll lose Mage-OS specific features, but your data will stay intact.

### How do I install Mage-OS?

**Magento from public mirror:**

```bash
composer create-project --repository-url=https://mirror.mage-os.org \
  magento/project-community-edition
```

```bash
composer create-project --repository-url=https://repo.mage-os.org \

## Technology

### What versions of Magento is Mage-OS based on?

Mage-OS is only focused on Magento 2, particularly the supported release line (2.4). For Magento 1, we encourage you to look at [OpenMage LTS](https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts).

The Mage-OS Mirror repository provides all versions of Magento 2 since 2.3.7-p3. The Mage-OS Distribution is based on the latest Magento Open Source version.

### Will changes be merged into Magento Open Source?

We've had informal discussions with Adobe about merging Mage-OS PRs into Magento Open Source. The most likely process will be that Magento will cherry-pick commits they are interested in.

Regarding divergence: Our goal is to maintain backwards compatibility as long as possible, but Mage-OS and Magento will diverge over time.

### How do new feature proposals work?

For new features, we deliver these as separate packages. This allows for an independent release schedule and makes it easier to keep upstream compatibility with Magento Open Source intact.

So: new features = new modules, but improvements to the core that are backwards compatible can go into the Mage-OS core.

### Will Mage-OS have extra modules not in Magento Open Source?

Yes, add-on modules are the plan for enhancements and additions to the platform. This has numerous advantages, including easier maintenance, separate release schedules, and keeping the main repository closer to the upstream Magento core.
