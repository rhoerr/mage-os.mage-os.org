## Welcome to the Mage-OS Community

The Mage-OS community is built on a foundation of mutual respect, collaboration, and shared passion for open-source e-commerce. Whether you are contributing code, asking questions, attending events, or simply learning, you are a valued member of our community.

This Code of Conduct exists not as a list of restrictions, but as a shared agreement that helps us work together effectively and ensures everyone can participate fully and safely. We believe that diverse perspectives strengthen our project and that every community member deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.

> **Quick Summary:** Be respectful, be inclusive, be collaborative. If you see something concerning, report it to [conduct@mage-os.org](mailto:conduct@mage-os.org). We take all reports seriously and will respond within 48 hours.

All participants of Mage-OS are expected to abide by our Code of Conduct, both online and during in-person events that are hosted and/or associated with Mage-OS. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participant behavior as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all Mage-OS community spaces, including but not limited to:

- GitHub repositories and discussions
- Discord server and other chat platforms
- Mailing lists and forums
- In-person and virtual events, meetups, and conferences
- Social media interactions when representing Mage-OS
- Any other spaces where community members interact on behalf of or in connection with Mage-OS

## The Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, and we expect all community members to help us create and maintain this environment.

- Attacking personal tastes
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Code Review and Contribution Guidelines

Open-source contribution involves giving and receiving feedback. Here are specific guidelines for maintaining a healthy contribution culture:

### For Reviewers

- **Focus on the code, not the person** - Critique the work, not the contributor
- **Be specific and constructive** - Instead of "this is wrong," explain what could be improved and why
- **Acknowledge good work** - Positive feedback is as valuable as constructive criticism
- **Be timely** - Respect contributors' time by reviewing promptly when possible
- **Ask questions** - If you do not understand something, ask rather than assume
- **Offer suggestions, not demands** - Use phrases like "Consider..." or "What do you think about..."

### For Contributors

- **Be open to feedback** - Remember that reviewers are trying to help improve the project
- **Respond professionally** - Even if you disagree, engage respectfully
- **Ask for clarification** - If feedback is unclear, ask questions rather than guessing
- **Do not take criticism personally** - Code review is about the code, not your worth as a developer
- **Be patient** - Maintainers are often volunteers with limited time

### General Collaboration

- **Document your reasoning** - Help others understand why you made certain decisions
- **Keep discussions focused** - Stay on topic and move tangential discussions to appropriate channels
- **Respect different approaches** - There is often more than one valid solution to a problem

## Accessibility and Accommodations

We are committed to making Mage-OS accessible to everyone:

- **Communication accommodations** - We strive to provide multiple ways to participate (text, voice, video)
- **Event accessibility** - In-person events should be accessible; please reach out if you need accommodations
- **Language considerations** - Be patient with non-native English speakers and avoid idioms when possible
- **Time zone inclusivity** - We try to rotate meeting times to accommodate different regions
- **Documentation** - We aim to make documentation clear and accessible to people with varying technical backgrounds

## Reporting Guidelines
