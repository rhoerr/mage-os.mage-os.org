<p>Join us for our 2024 annual assembly! This is the time when we review our activities for the last year, share plans for the future, and hear your voices and votes on the future of Mage-OS.</p>



<p>This meeting is open to members and partners of Mage-OS only. If you want to join, please <a href="/community/partners">Join Mage-OS</a>. Please note our voter roll closes 30 days prior to the event.</p>



<p>As a community association, our members are our highest authority. If you want to bring a matter to a vote, this is your chance.</p>



<p>This assembly also marks the end of a year of association activities, including acceptance of the previous financial year and a year in the term of office for all elected positions. As this was the first complete year of Mage-OS Association activities, we currently do not have any board seats open for election. In next year's assembly, four seats will be up for election.</p>



<p>The event will be virtual and hosted on Zoom, at 3 PM Central Europe Time on June 19th. All members have received an invitation email with the details. If you have a topic to raise, or any questions, please contact us at <a href="mailto:board@mage-os.org">board@mage-os.org</a>.</p>
