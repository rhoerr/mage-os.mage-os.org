From February 27 to March 1, 2025, the first-ever **Hyvä Developers Paradise** took place at the Lopesan Baobab Resort in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. This remarkable event was dedicated to Magento developers and eCommerce professionals. But this was more than just a technical conference. It was a gathering of like-minded individuals, celebrating community, collaboration, and shared purpose.

**New milestones for the Hyvä ecosystem** were unveiled during the event, including **Hyvä Commerce**—a suite of products enhancing Magento Open Source with a modern admin panel and advanced features—and **Hyvä CMS**, a fully redesigned content management system built for flexibility and usability. These innovations are a testament to the fact that, with strong community support, Magento remains one of the most powerful and adaptable eCommerce platforms.

### **A Community at the Center: Unity Through Collaboration**

One of the clearest takeaways from these action-packed days was a renewed awareness: **Magento still holds a vital place in the eCommerce world**, but maintaining that position requires collective effort. The presence of **Mage-OS** and the **Magento Association** as community sponsors underscored the importance of joining forces to strengthen and evolve the Magento ecosystem.

Many Mage-OS contributors were present, openly discussing what it would take to bring Magento back to the market position it deserves. One message was clear: **collaboration is the only path forward**—between developers, agencies, vendors, and professionals across the industry.

Attending Hyvä Developers Paradise wasn’t just about discovering new tech or hearing the latest product updates. It was about **actively** **participating in a community shaping the future of open-source eCommerce**. Magento remains the only valid alternative for those who value customization, flexibility, and robust capabilities. And it’s this community—when united and energized—that can help the platform survive and thrive.

### **Mage-OS and the Power of Open Collaboration**

One of the most exciting aspects of the event was the **in-depth, real-time dialogue around Mage-OS**—the community-driven fork of Magento. Talking with other developers provided invaluable insights into the platform’s evolution and direction.

Despite coming from different backgrounds, teams, and experiences, everyone shared a common goal: to make Mage-OS a stable, reliable, and forward-thinking alternative.

Some developers have already begun experimenting with Mage-OS in staging environments, while others are even running it in production—evaluating its compatibility with third-party extensions and testing its real-world stability. These trials are critical in identifying strengths, pinpointing gaps, and steering future improvements. The fact that so many professionals are dedicating time and effort to test and contribute to Mage-OS shows how deeply this community believes in its potential.

### **A Shared Goal That Knows No Borders**

One recurring theme in every conversation was the importance of **having a shared vision**. It doesn’t matter where we come from, what language we speak, or what part of the world we’re coding in. What matters is having a **common purpose** and moving forward—together.

Meeting other developers face-to-face drove home the point: without unity, we risk fragmentation, which slows progress. It’s the **community glue**—continuous, open, and constructive dialogue—that holds this ecosystem together. Without it, we risk missing out on the innovations that only collective effort can bring.

### **Becoming a Voice for the Community**

One thing that struck me during the event was how many agencies that have worked with Magento for years **still weren’t aware of Mage-OS**. That realization pushed me to become more than a user—I became an advocate. I spent time talking to teams, sharing what’s been achieved so far, and encouraging them to use Mage-OS and become part of the journey.

Magento has always had a strong community. However, to grow, the project needs not only developers but also agencies, professionals, and stakeholders to get involved. It’s time to move from **passive users to active contributors**—whether that means writing code, giving feedback, improving documentation, or simply spreading the word.

As Helen Keller once said:  
**"Alone, we can do so little; together, we can do so much."**

### **Beyond Code: Human Connections Matter**

Hyvä Developers Paradise wasn’t just about code and tech talks. At its heart, this was an event about **people**. Yes, there were deep-dive sessions and technical content—but there were also bowling, tennis matches, dance parties, and sunset drinks by the ocean.

These shared moments created bonds that went far beyond the professional. Often, **the best ideas come from the most unexpected conversations**—over a drink, during a tennis match, or walking along the beach. The real power of the Magento community lies in this, too: the ability to build authentic relationships around a shared passion.

### **Magento Has a Future—But It’s Up to Us**

Hyvä Developers Paradise 2025 was a bold reminder that **Magento’s strength isn’t just in the code—it’s in the people who believe in it** and commit to improving it daily.

More than an event, this was a statement of purpose: **Magento has a bright future—but only if the community stays united, engaged, and committed**.

For those working with Magento or curious about the future of open-source eCommerce, events like this aren’t just professional opportunities. They’re a chance to contribute to a mission bigger than any single company or product.

Magento needs its community.  
And the community needs Magento.

As Aristotle once said:  
**"The whole is greater than the sum of its parts."**

Now more than ever, that truth resonates deeply within our community.
