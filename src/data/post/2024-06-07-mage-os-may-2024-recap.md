## Marketing Updates

- **Focus:** increase Magento brand awareness, countering competitors and debunking the myth that Magento is dead. We're launching a new campaign with consistent visuals and taglines to highlight the strength of Magento's community and ecosystem.

- **Magento-opensource.com Project Progress:** 
    - The objective of magento-opensource.com is to provide merchants with information about the benefits of choosing Magento Open Source for their eCommerce website.
    
    - It will complement Mage-OS.org, which is more technical and developer focused.
    
    - This initiative is being led by Danny Verkade from the Magento Association, ensuring alignment with community goals to bring the Magento brand back to the market.
    
    - The goal is to launch a MVP site by Meet Magento UK (June 18th, 2024) to highlight the platform's unmatched features, the advantages of open source, and Magento’s community and history.

- **LinkedIn Campaign:** Our goal is to increase Magento's share of voice. Strong campaign visuals development is being led by David Lambauer and UK agency Vovi studio. The idea is to leverage media assets from the whole community to create cut through and compete with other platforms and their massive marketing budget.

## Development Progress

- **Admin UI Enhancements:** Artem Kozynets is working on a new sticky mode and other UI enhancements to admin grids.

- **Build Issues:** Vinai Kopp is resolving version conflicts in libraries and Magento functional testing framework compatibility, in preparation for our next Mage-OS Distribution release.

- **AI Product Data Generation:** Ryan Sun has released version 0.2.1 of the AI module, with a new back-off mechanism for API responses. [See, use, or contribute to it on the Mage-OS Lab repository](https://github.com/mage-os-lab/module-catalog-data-ai).

See our [Technical Initiatives project board](https://tree.taiga.io/project/mage-os-mage-os-technical-initiatives/timeline) for more info or to help out. We have many tasks available to pick up!

## Community Engagement

- **Member Contributions:** We're always looking for more participation from the community to improve Magento’s functionalities.  
    

- **Recognition System:** We're starting a new badge system to reward active community members and showcase the impact of their contributions. Stay tuned.

**Thank you for your continued support and contributions. Together, we’re building a stronger Magento!**
