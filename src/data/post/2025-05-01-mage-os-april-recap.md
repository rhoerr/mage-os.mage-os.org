### Mage-OS 1.1.1 Released

Mage-OS version 1.1.0 has been released, featuring a redesigned admin theme created by [Artem Kozynets.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/artem-kozynets/) This release introduced visual improvements and received positive feedback from users and contributors. Learn more [here](https://mage-os.org/updates/m137-admin-theme/).

Version 1.1.1 was released shortly after to fix a bug in configurable products and make small adjustments to the admin theme. Additional user experience enhancements, including message layout and accessibility improvements, are planned for future updates.

The new admin theme is being widely adopted, with over 200 Figma design uses and growing engagement on GitHub. It is likely to become the default in upcoming releases.

### Module Management and Namespace Strategy

There is ongoing discussion about how and when modules from the `mageos-lab` namespace should graduate to the official `mageos` namespace. While no formal process exists yet, the current consensus is that modules should only be moved when they meet specific criteria such as wide usage, maturity, or inclusion in a Mage-OS release.

Task #59 in Taiga is tracking the development of formal acceptance criteria. Feel free to help with the ticket!

### DeepWiki Integration

A set of Mage-OS repositories has been indexed by [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com), providing AI-powered, explorable documentation for:

- [mageos-magento2](https://deepwiki.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2)

- [infrastructure](https://deepwiki.com/mage-os/infrastructure)

- [github-actions](https://deepwiki.com/mage-os/github-actions)

- [terraform](https://deepwiki.com/mage-os/terraform)

- [generate-mirror-repo-js](https://deepwiki.com/mage-os/generate-mirror-repo-js)

This makes our codebase and tooling more accessible for newcomers and contributors alike..

### Community Discussions & RFCs

A few important technical proposals are under discussion:

Ideas for improving build and release independence of Mage-OS packages were raised — helpful for contributors managing their own version cycles.

**Semantic Versioning RFC**: Should Mage-OS adopt semantic versioning to signal breaking changes more clearly? [Join the discussion](https://discordapp.com/channels/893449664093904936/950670671145467924/1367151723583639584).

**Bundled Module Proposal**: There’s a proposal to include [Creatuity Interception](https://github.com/creatuity/magento2-interceptors) in the default Mage-OS release.

## **Opportunities**
