## 2024 Goals

With increased collaboration with Magento Association and Adobe, we’ve decided to shift our goals for the coming year. In 2024, our intentions are to:

- Make Mage-OS a tech incubator and place of innovation for the Magento ecosystem.  
    - Mage-OS is an independent distribution of Magento Open Source.  
        
    
    - Mage-OS will be a proving ground for innovation. As this works out, we will encourage Magento Open Source to include those same changes for future releases.

- We need your help developing the features and improvements that will help to keep Magento competitive and set it apart!  
      
    

- Show that ‘Magento is Alive’, and still a competitive modern ecommerce platform, through:  
    - Helping to create an all new magento-opensource.com marketing website  
        
    
    - Platform comparisons and selling resources (‘battle cards’)  
        
    
    - Exposure of the features, enhancements, and community that make Magento special

## Association News
