On 25th March, a couple of Mage-OS active members attended the first ever [Meet Magento France](https://fr.meet-magento.com/), and since [many recaps](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23mm25fr&origin=GLOBAL_SEARCH_HEADER&sid=JNM) have already been published online, we thought we’d provide a different angle to the story and shed more light on the organisation that was behind this whole event.

[Opengento](https://opengento.fr/), took inspiration from how Mage-OS Nederland organizes Meet Magento Netherlands, to ensure that - sometimes competing - agencies work in good spirit and collaboration and are all treated fairly alongside other contributing vendors.

They took on the responsibility of being the legal entity behind all the paperwork, be it legal or financial, including budget and taking financial risk for this very first edition, which turned out to be 10 times bigger than their usual week-ends. 

# What is Opengento’s story?

Opengento is a non for profit organization (French law of 1901) whose purpose is to organize open-source events for the French-speaking developer community.

To better understand this, let's go back to 2013, the year of the first MageConf (.org, not to be confused with .com). It was a sort of counter-event to the Bargento event, which would be less commercial and more organised for and by developers.

In 2014, the Opengento association was born during MageConf. The idea was simple: to bring together the French developer community for a weekend to code and network! 

Since the first Opengento event, which took place in 2015 in Toulouse, seven other weekends have been organized! 

To put it briefly, Opengento is an association that publishes POCs & modules during its hackathons (our famous Opengento weekends) in order to support innovation within the e-commerce developer community.

# What innovation has been brought by Opengento?

Opengento came up with a variety of modules that allow you to add several types of loggers (GELF, Slack, and others), or access Magento without a password ([Hoodoor](https://hoodoor.com/))

Other functionalities developed over Opengento Hackathons include:

- geolocation management by country

# How does Opengento fit with Adobe, the Magento Association or Mage-OS?

![](~/assets/images/blog/2025/20241010_095502-1024x768.jpg)

### Adobe

Adobe is dedicated to maintaining the **Magento Open Source** codebase, a commitment that has been strong since they acquired Magento in 2018. They directly manage the core code, releasing consistent updates that include security fixes and performance enhancements. 

For this, they have been investing in two key people:

**Parul Sinha**, a Software Engineering Manager at Adobe, focuses on fostering stronger ties with the developer community, managing programs that encourage contributions, and advocating for the community's needs to ensure their input shapes the roadmap.

**Ritesh Somani**, a Principal Product Manager at Adobe and a Magento Association board member, contributes to defining the product vision and roadmap, particularly for commerce and payments, and works to strengthen collaboration between Adobe and the community to keep Magento Open Source robust and merchant-focused.

You can meet them at key Meet Magento events in North America, and together, they work on maintaining the Magento Open Source codebase through initiatives such as:

- [**Community Prioritization Process**,](https://community.magento.com/t5/Magento-DevBlog/bg-p/devblog) to empower the community to influence the roadmap by upvoting pull requests for features and fixes they deem most important.

- **Core Codebase Ownership:** Adobe is the official steward, handling development, security, and compatibility.

- **Regular Releases:** They consistently issue updates, including security fixes and quality improvements, ensuring the platform stays current.

- **Showcasing Magento Open Source** and how it helps SMB merchants scale their eCommerce stores and capabilities at their own pace.

### The Magento Association

The [Magento Association](https://www.magentoassociation.org/home) is backed by Adobe. Their main objective is to promote the Magento brand and eCommerce platform and Community. 

- They grant the rights to use the “[Meet Magento](https://www.meet-magento.com/)” branding for events and they provide strong support to those events.

- Now you can refer to the [Magento Open Source official website](https://magento-opensource.com/) to find key resources about the platform’s features, including the key [advantages of Open Source](https://magento-opensource.com/magento-open-source/magento-open-source-open-source-advantage/) vs SaaS in eCommerce

- You can also tag Magento Open Source on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/magento-open-source/) again, to give it more visibility as a brand and code base in its own right, showcasing fantastic projects that go live everyday.

In the last year or so, the Magento Association gave a big boost to its activities and more clarity to its governance. 

Here are their 2025 big priorities and [board members’ roles and responsibilities](https://www.magentoassociation.org/commerce-co-op/full-article/magento-association-march-2025-town-hall-highlights-and-key-takeaways) to achieve their goals:

1\. Financial Health & Funding the Future 

2\. Membership, Sponsorship & Sustainability 

3\. Events: The Heartbeat of the Community 

4\. Marketing, Transparency, and Community Engagement 

5\. Empowering Developers & Contributors 

6\. Elevating Agency Value 

7\. Magento Champion Programme

8\. Documentation Reimagined 

9\. Governance & Sustainability 

10\. Adobe’s Vision for the Future

What has been quite visible so far is how their Marketing task force, led by Laura Folco staffed up big times with high profile members such as Emily Sturges, Rebecca Brocton and Ola Czapiewska , and you can already see the momentum they are gaining, starting with their [LinkedIn activities](https://www.linkedin.com/company/magentoassociation/posts/?feedView=all).

### Mage-OS

As a foundation to raise awareness about the structural advantages of the Magento Open Source platform, we gathered all the reasons [why Open Source is beneficial for eCommerce](https://magento-opensource.com/magento-open-source/magento-open-source-open-source-advantage/) merchants, including ownership and control of their stores, data, security, resilience but also unmatched flexibility and differentiation and THE COMMUNITY.

Now that the promotion of the Magento brand is now in safe hands with the Magento Association, we are shifting our focus to becoming a **technology incubator**, giving Magento developers a playground to build and test things such as:

- A brand [new Admin Pane](/updates/2025-04-10-m137-admin-theme)l to  make it more modern, intuitive and fun for Magento users!

- [AI powered documentation](/initiatives/2025-05-06-the-evolution-of-documentation-in-the-age-of-ai-a-magento-case-study) so developers spend more time on what they love and less on tedious tasks

- Automatic [Translation Modules,](/initiatives/2025-02-08-transforming-magento-the-power-of-community-contributions-and-innovation) Import/Export for Page Builder Modules

- And [many more](/?cat_ID=40)

Our role is to nurture innovation, and provide opportunities and path to be rolled out into the core platform to maintain its competitive edge and relevance while the eCommerce landscape is undergoing a huge revolution both technology wise but also regulatory wise.

### Localised Magento developers associations: Opengento, Firegento, Magentiamo, Mage-OS Netherlands and more

Grassroot initiatives are at the heart of the Magento Community and is the tightest bond that brings people together. 

The same way Opengento comes up with innovative solutions to problems they see in their markets, other countries also have their local associations:

[**Firegento**](http://firegento.com) **(Germany)**

The German association (e.V.) with a long history of contributing to Magento Open Source is  known for organizing community events: hackathons, meetups and most importantly [Unconferences](https://www.mageunconference.org/), and developing useful tools and modules for the platform. 

**GitHub:** [https://github.com/firegento](https://github.com/firegento)

[**Mage-OS NL**](https://nl.mage-os.org/en/) **(Netherlands)**

Local chapter of the broader Mage-OS initiative, they are a non-profit association specifically for the Dutch Magento community, aiming to revive and represent the Magento/Adobe Commerce/Mage-OS ecosystem in the Netherlands through events, information sharing, and community facilitation. Their biggest achievement is the big come back of [Meet Magento Netherlands!](https://nl.meet-magento.com/)

[**Magentiamo**](https://www.magentiamo.it/) **(Italy)**

For over 10 years now, the Italian association has been organizing events and community initiatives such as a **Community Portal/Resource** that provides support, development insights, consulting, and hosting solutions specifically for Magento users in Italy. 

Get ready for the comeback of [Meet Magento Italy 2025](https://it.meet-magento.com/)!

And this is just the visible tip of the iceberg.

In short, the more the merrier. From super localised initiatives just like all the regional meet ups like in [Magento Meet-up Austria](https://www.meetup.com/magento-meetup-austria/), or  [Magento Stammtisch Rhein Main](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/magento-stammtisch-rhein-main/) who recently celebrated their 50th edition to giant gathering at eCommerce expo like Webwinkelvakdagen or at Adobe Summit, every occasion to meet sparks passion, ideas, innovation and strengthen friendship, which the core and heart of our Magento Community.
