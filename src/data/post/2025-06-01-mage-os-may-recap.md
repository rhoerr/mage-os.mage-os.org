## Mage-OS Technical Highlights - May Recap

- A new **CMS Widget Preview** module is complete and undergoing testing, making it easier to preview widgets directly in Page Builder.

- A proposal was made for a **"Discover MageOS" module hub**, allowing admin users to browse featured modules inside Magento.

- A lightweight **GeoIP Redirect Module** was introduced using MaxMind’s free database, no external API required.

- The **MetaTag** and **MetaRobots** modules were moved into the main MageOS namespace. A **Newsletter Coupon** module was also contributed.

- Continued work on the **Admin Theme**, including fixes for emulation issues. Adoption is increasing steadily.

- Discussion around switching from **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** to **Calendar Versioning (CalVer)** is ongoing.

- A plugin naming edge case was identified; guidance will be added for affected modules.

## **Opportunities**

- Have a contribution idea or interested in the Mage-OS Distribution? Join our weekly tech meetings, public on [Discord](http://chat.mage-os.org/) at 3 PM CET / 2 PM UTC / 9 AM EST every Tuesday: chat.mage-os.org

- We’re looking for new features to enhance Mage-OS this year that will help to modernize and excite merchants. This might include AI enhancements, low/no code processes, or more. Talk to Vinai Kopp or #tech if you’re interested!
