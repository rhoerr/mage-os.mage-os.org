The recently-released Magento 2.4.6 (along with 2.4.5-p2, and 2.4.4-p3) is now available on all Mage-OS mirror and distribution repositories. We had to delay the release briefly because of a missing release tag on one of the upstream Magento repositories, which we reported and has since been corrected.

If you're interested in using a Mage-OS repository, please see the [Mage-OS Distribution](/get-started/installation) page!

Currently all packages are exact copies of the official Magento packages for each release. This will change as soon as we release our own Mage-OS Distribution.

## Mage-OS Association Progress

We are making progress on establishing the Mage-OS Association. Recently the Polish court fully approved and filed the association in the national registry. We are now working through legal steps for handling of taxes, opening a bank account, and choosing an accountant. We expect to open membership and finances as soon as those steps come together.
