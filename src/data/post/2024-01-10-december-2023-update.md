## Magento Meetup Aachen

![Magento Meetup Aachen](~/assets/images/blog/2024/aachen-mage-os-MA-1024x771.jpg)

It was great to connect with people in Aachen! Our president, Vinai, attended and gave a talk, and you can read a nice recap of the event from integer\_net: [https://www.integer-net.com/blog\_english/magento-meetup-aachen-christmas-mage-os-magento-association-en](https://www.integer-net.com/blog_english/magento-meetup-aachen-christmas-mage-os-magento-association-en)

## Magento Women Initiative

![Women In Tech Facts](~/assets/images/blog/2024/20231102_113447-1024x768.jpg)

Recently a talk at Meet Magento Netherlands 2023 called “7 ways to be an ally for Women in Tech” sparked conversation and bonding between women at the event. Women are underrepresented, at only 27% of the workforce in the industry. This inequality intensifies the more you go up in the responsibility levels, with only 1 in 7 of CEOs being women.

On the other side of the Atlantic, [Parul Sinha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parul-sinha-87965240/) (who is looking after the Open Source Community at Adobe) is the Austin site lead for Women at Adobe. That program is very mature and includes career highlights, sessions on women’s health, as well as a platform to facilitate networking and support on any topic from relationship and parenting advice to soft and hard skills like crafting slides or improving communication.

For Magento and Mage-OS, where [diversity and inclusion have always been part of our Community culture and values](/updates/2022-09-20-diversity-and-inclusion), the purpose of this initiative is huge as it will help both grow the Magento Community and skill up each business in the ecosystem. Here’s how:

- By attracting more women to the Magento ecosystem, we get a bigger talent pool of more diverse people

- If every woman in the Magento ecosystem gains confidence, a stronger network, and soft and hard skills with the help of their peers, that will help businesses to flourish, and everybody wins

With those objectives in mind, we took a couple a first steps, in cooperation with Parul, Marsha Naidoo, Sanne Bolkenstein, Thien-Lan Weber, Suzanne von Ameronen, and others:

1. We already gathered nearly 50 women on the **[Mage-Chat Slack channel](https://www.magechat.club/)** sharing some useful tips and lots of good vibes. **Join us by emailing [suzanne@magechat.club](mailto:suzanne@magechat.club)**

2. We’ve lined up in-person meetings on three continents over the next three months

 Save the Dates:

1. Europe: Dinner in Utrecht (the Netherlands) on January 22nd

3. USA: Get together at [Meet Magento Florida](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/women-in-ecommerce-tickets-783175497997?aff=oddtdtcreator) on January 31th from 5.30 to 6.30pm

5. Asia: Get together at [Meet Magento India](https://www.meetmagento.in/) February 10th

Join us on Slack for details and to register. Also [follow us on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mage-os) to be notified when event registrations opens.
