Adobe has released updates to Magento Open Source today, versions 2.4.5-p1 and 2.4.4-p2.

Those same updates are now also available if you’re using our Magento mirror composer repository, `mirror.mage-os.org`. Our validation has confirmed the mirror releases are installable and match the official releases.

Thanks to Vinai Kopp and Damien Retzinger for managing the release process.

If you’re not yet using the Mage-OS Magento mirror, you can do that today by swapping `repo.magento.com` to `mirror.mage-os.org` in your composer.json (unless you require any Magento Marketplace packages). This is a public repository, built by our independent open source build process from the Magento 2 source code. For more info on the Mage-OS nightly and mirror repositories, see: [https://mage-os.org/distribution](/get-started/installation)

We have plans to launch the Mage-OS Distribution and start accepting pull requests by the end of this year. Stay tuned for more!
