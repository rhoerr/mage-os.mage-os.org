## Community and Leadership

_Themes, Transitions, and Tactical Wins_

July has been a pivotal month for Mage-OS, marked by major strides across frontend innovation, developer documentation, infrastructure planning, and ecosystem health. This update brings together the key milestones, debates, and next steps as the team sharpens both vision and execution.

## Let’s Meet: Pizza, Code, and Community

We’ve been shipping code, squashing bugs, and debating theme architecture… but when was the last time we just sat down over pizza and talked face-to-face?

If you’re part of the Mage-OS or Magento community and want to meet others near you (no slides, no pressure, just pizza and good conversation) why not help organize a local hangout?

Would you be up for hosting a small gathering in your city?  
Whether it’s five people at a local pizzeria or ten in a coworking space, it’s a great way to connect beyond the screen. We’ll help spread the word, just drop a message in Discord with your location and interest.

Let’s get together. Share stories, challenges, and maybe a few terrible deployment war tales.

**Technical Progress**

The new **[Community Modules Directory](/community)** went live, giving users a central place to find open-source extensions built for Mage-OS. Modules are now organized by category. including AI-powered and in-development tools, and contributors are encouraged to get involved directly via the site. Alongside this, a draft of the **[Versioning Strategy](/product/releases)** page was shared internally to formalize how Mage-OS communicates release cycles. DevDocs saw several improvements, including a new contributors section, a tutorial for custom product links, and updated installation recommendations favoring **MariaDB** to better align with upstream.

On the frontend, the **UIKit Theme project**, led by Davide, hit a milestone with the publication of its base module. Thanks to automatic CSS class detection, the theme no longer requires custom XML files for class safelisting. Performance testing showed promising CSS file size reductions, and conversations began around trimming JS dependencies based on routes, though compatibility concerns (especially with third-party modules) remain. Meanwhile, **admin theme work** continued steadily, focusing on improved newsletter queues, editor previews, and better widget styling. The next release is targeted for mid-August.

Looking ahead to August, the team is preparing for the next admin theme release, continuing UIKit development, and watching closely for Adobe’s response on Zend Framework, CSP compliance, and TinyMCE. Migration of contribution guidelines into DevDocs is also on the horizon.

Mage-OS is moving with intention, streamlining where it can, rethinking what needs rethinking, and focusing on building a cleaner, more flexible future for Magento users and contributors alike.

## **Opportunities**
