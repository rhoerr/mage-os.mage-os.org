For more than fifteen years, Magento has stood as one of the most solid, flexible, and complete e-commerce platforms in the world. Thousands of merchants, agencies, and developers have built their digital growth on it, thanks to an open-source model that has always enabled freedom, innovation, and collaboration.

In recent years, Magento’s evolution has followed different paths: on one side, the commercial version managed by Adobe; on the other, the growing need — strongly felt by merchants and developers — to preserve the open-source philosophy and ensure long-term continuity for the platform.

This is where Mage-OS was born: an independent, community-driven, and completely free project that carries forward Magento’s legacy into the future.

**Continuity and full compatibility**

Mage-OS is not a new or alternative platform — it is the direct evolution of Magento Open Source.

The codebase remains fully compatible, ensuring that existing modules, extensions, and themes continue to work without modification.

For merchants and agencies, this means stability and continuity, without the need to start from scratch.

The goal is to offer a modern, secure, and constantly updated platform while preserving everything that makes Magento so powerful: its modular structure, flexibility, and technological independence.

**An active and growing community**

Mage-OS is a community-driven project: developers, agencies, and businesses around the world contribute every day to its development, documentation, testing, and promotion.

This network of people and expertise is the beating heart of the project — not a community waiting for updates, but a community creating them.

The work is transparent and public: every contribution can be seen on GitHub, and anyone can participate, suggest improvements, or join working groups dedicated to performance, security, compatibility, or communication.

**Open source. Always.**

One of the core principles of Mage-OS is its open-source license, which will remain that way forever.

The project is and will always be free, with no “premium” versions or paid tiers.

Its mission is to keep the platform accessible to everyone, supporting a sustainable model where innovation is shared and benefits the entire ecosystem.

In a market where many platforms are becoming closed or subscription-based, Mage-OS stands as a choice of freedom, transparency, and long-term reliability.

**A long-term vision**

Mage-OS is not a temporary fork — it’s a project with a clear, long-term vision.

Thanks to the coordinated work of an international board, active contributors, and the support of strategic partners, Mage-OS ensures regular updates, ongoing security improvements, and compatibility with the latest PHP versions and libraries.

Its roadmap is open and public, giving anyone who adopts Mage-OS the confidence that the platform will continue to grow and evolve to support their business in the years ahead.

**A future built together**

Mage-OS doesn’t belong to a single company — it belongs to a global community.

Every merchant, agency, and developer who chooses Mage-OS helps it grow and thrive.

This shared vision is what makes the project truly unique: an open, living, and ever-evolving ecosystem capable of providing both stability today and innovation tomorrow.

In a digital landscape that’s changing faster than ever, Mage-OS represents the perfect balance between heritage and innovation — the technical continuity of Magento, powered by the passion and commitment of a community that believes in the open-source future.

Mage-OS doesn’t replace Magento. It evolves it.
