**Looking Back on an Awesome Year with Mage-OS – Happy New Year!**

As 2024 wraps up, we want to take a moment to celebrate everything we’ve accomplished together and thank the amazing Mage-OS and Magento communities who made it all happen. This year has been incredible, full of progress, teamwork, and creative ideas.

### Highlights from the Year

**January - March:** We started the year strong, kicking off exciting projects and sparking conversations about Magento’s future. Some big moments included the Mage-OS async events and Gowri’s inspiring journey with asynchronous systems. February’s Mage-OS Nederland member meeting was another highlight, showing how global our community truly is.

**April - June:** Spring kept the momentum going! In April, we celebrated new contributions and shared exciting plans for the platform. By June, we saw awesome progress in tools and community engagement, cementing Mage-OS as a space for fresh ideas and growth. We also had our first hire!

**July - September:** Summer was packed with activity, including community events like the Magento meetups across North America and Europe. These gatherings brought us closer together and sparked creative solutions for the future. This September defined our community, showcasing just how much we can achieve when we work together.

**October - December:** The final months of the year were full of energy and achievements. November’s release of Mage-OS Distribution 1.0.5 was a new milestone, reflecting the incredible effort and expertise of contributors worldwide. The behind-the-scenes stories from September's and November’s events gave us a glimpse into the exciting possibilities ahead. The tech channel also became a lively hub, buzzing with ideas and collaboration. We were happy to welcome Fabrizio to the team, whose fresh perspective and innovative ideas have already made a big impact. We had our first retro and identified some exciting changes ahead to help improve our processes. The Italian community and events were set up and we're excited to see the new activity and ideas!

**Reclaiming the Magento Brand**

Together with the [Magento Association](http://magentoassociation.org), we achieved something truly historic this year: we bought back the Magento brand. This is a massive achievement for our community and a testament to what we can accomplish together. To celebrate and raise awareness about Magento, we ran an extensive campaign across social media, with many LinkedIn posts showcasing the vibrant, dedicated community. If you haven’t already, check out our LinkedIn page for more highlights and stories: Mage-OS LinkedIn.

The Magento Association and Mage-OS have been collaborating to strengthen the Magento community through joint initiatives. We’ve engaged the community with collaborative discussions, and events to gather ideas and feedback, aiming to enhance the Magento Open Source ecosystem. Additionally, we are co-developing improved merchant documentation, hosted on a new domain ([magento-opensource.com](https://magento-opensource.com/)), which provides comprehensive guidance for configuring and using Magento 2, with options for both Magento Open Source and Mage-OS screenshots.

### An Incredible Community

Throughout 2024, our community has been at the heart of everything we’ve done. Your passion, creativity, and support have made all the difference. From writing code to attending events and sharing ideas, every contribution has mattered.

Thank you to everyone who’s been part of this journey. Mage-OS wouldn’t be what it is without you, and together we’ve shown what’s possible when we work as a team.

### Looking Ahead to 2025

As we head into the new year, we’re excited to keep building on everything we’ve achieved. 2025 is shaping up to be another big year with new projects, partnerships, and chances to grow. We can’t wait to see what we’ll accomplish together.

Join us at our Marketing and Tech meetings or the Italian sessions—we’re always glad to see new and familiar faces there!

### Happy New Year!

From everyone at Mage-OS, we hope you have a fantastic New Year. Here’s to more milestones, more teamwork, and another awesome year with the Mage-OS community. Let’s make 2025 our best year yet!
