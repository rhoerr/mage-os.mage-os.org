- Vinai and Christian continue working on updates to the Magento Mirrors and Mage-OS Distribution for the recent Magento updates.

## Events

- Meet Magento Romania - Mage-OS Panel  
      
    - Board Members Maceij and John formed part of an impromptu panel, to replace Mathias Schreiber’s Magento Association talk, given he was sadly unable to attend. Alongside long-time Mage-OS contributors Ivan Chepurnyi and Jakub Winkler, and hosted by event organizer Vald Stanescu, the panel discussed all things Magento, Adobe, Magento Association, and of course, Mage-OS, including the positivity we see in the community, our joint collaboration efforts (with the MA) and the need to promote the Magento brand/platform.
