Are you passionate about open-source eCommerce? Do you believe in the power of community-led innovation? Mage-OS is growing — and now is your chance to help lead the charge.

We are excited to announce that **candidate applications are now open** for the **Mage-OS Board of Directors** and the **Business Control Committee (BCC)**. As we prepare for our June 2025 election, we’re calling on committed individuals from across the community to step forward and get involved.

**Apply now:** [Mage-OS Candidate Application Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdUJeVlSkL-Dm0yMmyASOmp6uiXBOOOg-b_5lrLuLFpNsMvMA/viewform?usp=dialog)

## Why Join the Mage-OS Leadership?

Mage-OS is more than a fork — it’s a movement. As a board or committee member, you’ll play a key role in shaping the vision, strategy, and future of Mage-OS. Whether your strengths lie in governance, communication, community building, or technical insight, there’s a place for your voice at the table.

### Open Positions:

- **Four (4) Board of Directors seats**

- **One (1) Business Control Committee seat**

- **Standby candidates for both roles**

All elected roles serve **two-year terms** and are open to any active Mage-OS Association member.

## What Does the Board Do?

The **Board of Directors** drives the heart of Mage-OS. Board members are deeply involved in setting organizational direction, leading key initiatives, and representing the project both within the community and to the wider world. Formal and informal roles may include:

- Strategy & governance

- Community & partner engagement

- Marketing, outreach, and events

- Infrastructure & technical planning

- Legal and financial oversight

We’re looking for hands-on leaders — people who don’t just believe in open source, but who are ready to help build a better one.

Get to know the [Mage-OS Leadership Team](/about/leadership) to see who's currently serving and get inspired to take part.

## What About the BCC?

The **Business Control Committee (BCC)** is our financial and organizational watchdog — an independent body ensuring that Mage-OS remains transparent, accountable, and in line with its mission. It’s a smaller time commitment (quarterly meetings), but with big impact.

## Ready to Run?

### To apply, you must:

- Be a current Mage-OS Association member (membership starts at just €10/year)

- Complete a short application form sharing your background, ideas, and availability

### Deadline: Applications are open now ahead of the **June 2025 General Assembly**

The **deadline to apply is 31 May 2025.** Whether you’ve contributed to Magento, Mage-OS, or just have a passion for community-driven software — your perspective matters. This is your opportunity to step up, speak out, and help steer one of the most promising open-source commerce projects today.
