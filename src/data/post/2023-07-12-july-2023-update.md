We know many of you have been impatient to learn more about how Mage-OS is progressing, both from the organization side with our association and also from the product side with the Mage-OS distribution, so here’s a roundup of everything that we’ve been working on over the past couple of months.

## Mage-OS Membership

In full transparency, getting to a point to start welcoming members to our association has taken us much longer than expected, and we have encountered many hurdles we didn’t anticipate. This has mainly been around setting up a global not-for-profit organization and all the paperwork required to make sure we do things right, such as accepting funds for legal and legitimate activities along with the appropriate accounting and tax considerations.

This has included the need for our President, Vinai, to travel in person to Poland (where our association has been legally founded) to set up and finalize bank details with fellow board member Maciej, who has been instrumental in forming the association.

Following this visit, we can now proudly announce that we have a bank account, and as soon as we have an accounting firm and some minor details finalized (which will hopefully only take a few more weeks), we can open membership and sponsorships to help finance our next growth stage.

## Tech / Product

### Mage-OS Distribution

Things are progressing well, and we’re keeping this update brief, so focus can be kept on finalising our own Distribution. We’ve now been able to build a working Mage-OS install (where packages are installed under the `mage-os`, not `magento` composer vendor namespace). The final steps are to perform some code cleanup and finalise the CI (Continuous Integration) process. Keep an eye out for more updates soon!

[About the Mage-OS Distribution](/get-started/installation)

### 2.4.6-p1 update

In case you missed it, Magento Open Source 2.4.6-p1 was released last month, and that’s available on our mirror as well: [mirror.mage-os.org](https://mirror.mage-os.org)

### Sonassi Mirror

We are delighted to announce support from Sonassi, a leading hosting company in the UK. Here is the link to their dedicated Mage-OS mirror: [mirror.sonassi.com](https://mirror.sonassi.com/)

## Content

### Mage-OS Website

Since the new Mage-OS website launch earlier this year, the content team has been diligently working to continue enhancing the site. This includes richer content, and much improved design.

In particular, we are very proud of our new [Get Involved page](/community/contributing) and [Magento Developers Resource page](/community/contributing). 

A big shout out to everyone on the Content Committee for spending their spare time volunteering to help make these impactful improvements. In particular we’d like to thank Sergej Derzap and his team at [Amasty](https://amasty.com/) for the consistently excellent design output, and Indraneil Khedekar at [Content Scribers](https://www.contentscribers.com/) for bringing those designs to reality.

### Developer Documentation

One of our next areas of focus is developer documentation. While there has always been substantial documentation for developers since the launch of Magento 2, the docs have become less friendly with the recent move to Adobe’s Experience League. In addition, the devdocs have never provided a great or welcoming introductory section for newcomers and junior developers.

Work has already started on our own simplified and user-friendly version of the docs, initially focused on introductory content. A huge shout-out to David Lambauer from [run\_as\_root](https://run-as-root.sh/) for his time spent kicking this off. You can see the early results here: [https://devdocs.mage-os.org](https://devdocs.mage-os.org/docs).

Want to join the fun and contribute? Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/4q4nGk6e), and get hands-on with the content and code on [GitHub](https://github.com/mage-os/devdocs).

### Meet Magento UK Recap Article

It might be strange to talk about a recap for an event that hasn’t happened yet! However, we’re planning ahead to make sure we get the best content from one of the biggest Magento specific events in Europe to share with the wider community on our blog.

If you’re attending the event in London on Tuesday 18th July, and would like to share your feedback on any of the talks or your overall experiences from the day, please get in touch with us so we can include it in our article (with full credit of course!)

A big thanks to John Prendergast from [Aonach](https://aonach.com/), one of our regular committee members, for putting together [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xmo1Ld55w4cUYTPwP8tu96wEiQStpvUL1LdrOsQily8/edit#gid=0) that details the full agenda of the day so we can plan out who would like to cover which topics. Also thanks to Brent Peterson and his team at [Content Basis](https://www.contentbasis.io/) who have offered to help pull the final article(s) together once we have all the contributions.

### And That’s Not All…

We’re also working on multiple other areas, such as finalizing membership content for when that opens (which will include business directory listings); looking into an unbiased overview of all the storefront options available for Mage-OS / Magento Open Source; better guidelines and submission process for those that would like to contribute blog articles or case studies; and exploring improvements to our events page.

If any of the above sounds like something you’d be interested to help with, then please join us on our weekly content meetings on Mondays at 4 pm CEST / 10am EDT.

In addition, we’re always after more merchant case studies and insights/best practice articles for the site if you have something you’d like to contribute!

## Events

July is filled with hot events, especially in Europe, where you’ll be able to catch up with many Mage-OS board members, supporters and contributors. We’ll be bringing our much sought-after Mage-OS stickers to these events too, so don’t miss out!

### MageUnconference Netherlands

Utrecht, 12-14th July

This is an unconference: Be prepared for plenty of fun and sharing. There is no program, there are no official speakers, there is just a group of developers chatting about all kinds of topics. Thank you to Jisse Reistma from Yireo and [Mage-OS Nederland](https://nl.mage-os.org/) for putting this together!

### MageUnconference Germany

Cologne, 29th September - 1st October

This Magento Unconference (MageUC) will be the first of its kind in Germany. It's similar to a regular conference, which means experts and specialists attend the event, presenting and listening to various talks, networking and gaining experience. In contrast to a regular conference, the event's focus is on conversations and open topics. Talks and speakers are collected and elected during the event. Every participant has a chance to get involved.
