As summer gets into full swing, the Mage-OS project has continued to grow and evolve. Over the past month, we’ve seen progress on technical improvements, community projects, website updates, and leadership changes. Here’s a look at everything that happened recently.

## Community and Leadership

### General Assembly and Elections

Mage-OS held its second-ever General Assembly, where members came together to vote on leadership roles and reflect on the progress made so far. A new board was elected for the 2025–2027 term, including:

- Vinai Kopp (President)

- David Lambauer (Vice President)

- Cezary Kozon (Treasurer)

- John Prendergast (Actuary)

- Michiel Gerritsen, Ruggero Landolina, and others as board members

- Francis Michael Gallagher joined the Business Control Committee

The community also thanked the outgoing board members for their time and dedication. Read more about the General Assembly [here](/updates/2025-06-19-mage-os-2nd-general-assembly-a-big-thank-you-to-the-community).

### Finances and Transparency

The Business Control Committee shared the 2024 financial report, showing that Mage-OS is in strong financial shape. The organization had more than 270,000 PLN in revenue and ended the year with a surplus of over 163,000 PLN. All finances were handled according to Polish nonprofit standards, and regular updates have kept the community informed.

## Technical Progress

### Website and Performance

- A new page called the “[Community Modules Directory](/community)” was added to the Mage-OS website. It highlights useful extensions made by the community, organized into different categories, and invites feedback.

- Website performance improved thanks to a new caching plugin, making the site faster for visitors.

### Build Process and Releases

- Work is ongoing to improve how Mage-OS builds and distributes releases. Efforts are focused on reusing existing files and reducing the time needed to build new versions.

- The team is experimenting with ways to run builds in parallel, but some limitations still exist due to tooling and infrastructure.

- [Version 1.2](/releases/2025-06-18-mage-os-1-2-0) was released recently, and early feedback has been very positive. The new admin theme received praise, and no major issues were reported.

## Frontend and Checkout Compliance

### New Theme in Progress

A new default frontend theme is in development. It’s based on the existing Blank theme and uses UIKit 3. The goal is to improve the customer-facing experience while staying compatible with existing modules. A preview version is being prepared for the community to try and give feedback.

### CSP and PCI-DSS Security

Checkout compliance continues to be a high priority. The team is exploring different ways to meet stricter security requirements (like PCI-DSS 4.0). Ideas include removing certain scripts and possibly using sandboxed iframes, similar to what Shopify does. These changes are not easy but are important for long-term security and compatibility with payment providers.

## Community Modules and Contributions

- Several modules have been moved into the official [Mage-OS namespace](https://github.com/mage-os), including [Vinai’s cache-cleaning module](https://github.com/mage-os/magento-cache-clean) and others that were previously hosted in MageOSLab..

- Contributions continue from agencies and developers, showing strong and steady engagement.

## Looking Ahead

Mage-OS is moving into a new phase focused on innovation and growth. The team is exploring an ambassador program to help spread the word and support the project globally.

There are also discussions about replacing the current WordPress site with a static site generator (like Hugo), which would make the website easier to maintain and contribute to.
