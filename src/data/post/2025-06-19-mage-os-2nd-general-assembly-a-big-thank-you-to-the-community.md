This week, we wrapped up our **second-ever General Assembly**, and we’re honestly feeling energized, proud, and deeply grateful for everyone who helped make it happen. From the new elections to exciting project updates, this was more than just a meeting, it was a celebration of what we’ve built together.

## Progress from the Community

This year’s updates reminded us just how much this community can accomplish. A few highlights:

- 100+ pull requests merged into the Mage-OS Distribution

- New Admin theme developed for both Mage-OS and Magento Open Source

- CMS widget preview and AI-based catalog content modules launched

- Solid infrastructure improvements and steady code maintenance

None of this happens without the time, care, and skill of contributors. Thank you!

## Growing Together

Mage-OS is now supported by:

- **13 partner organizations**

- **135 paying members**

- And a dedicated community of volunteers who show up each week to move things forward

It’s clear we’ve shifted out of “rescue mode” and into a new phase focused on **innovation, collaboration, and growth**. We’re also planning to launch an **Ambassador Program** to help represent and grow Mage-OS around the world.

## Looking Ahead

Our priorities for the coming year are clear:

- Keep building cool things

- Keep working closely with the Magento Association

- Stay open, transparent, and community-driven

- Make Mage-OS the best possible platform for everyone using and contributing to Magento Open Source

### BCC Report

**Financial Transparency and Strong Stewardship at Mage-OS in 2024**

The 2024 Business Control Committee report for Mage-OS reveals a year of sound financial stewardship and transparency. The organization generated a total of **270,398.75 PLN (~€62,170)**, raised entirely through donations and sponsorships via Open Collective. These contributions came from both individual supporters and companies aligned with Mage-OS’s open-source mission.

Total expenditures reached **107,056.62 PLN (~€24,610)**, primarily allocated to necessary non-profit operations. This included payments for legal and tax services, wages, and subscriptions to vital tools such as MailerLite, Bitwarden, and Zoom. As a result, Mage-OS ended the fiscal year with a healthy **net surplus of 163,342.13 PLN (~€37,560)**.

The BCC also highlighted the board’s exemplary commitment to transparency. Monthly financial updates were punctual and thorough, communication was responsive, and a financial FAQ, first recommended in the previous year, remained accurate and informative. The committee praised the board for cultivating a transparent and cooperative environment, laying a strong foundation for continued success in 2025.

### Thank You

To everyone who voted, joined the assembly, contributed code, helped with finances, supported others, or just showed up: **thank you**. Mage-OS is what it is because of you. This assembly reminded us how far we’ve come and how much more we can do together.

Here’s to another great year ahead!
