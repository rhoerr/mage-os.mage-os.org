We are excited to announce the release of **Mage-OS Distribution 2.1.0**, continuing our mission to provide a community-driven, open, and reliable e-commerce platform.

This release includes bug fixes, performance improvements, expanded database compatibility, and new developer tools.

### Our foundation

Mage-OS 2.1.0 is based on a solid foundation of proven, well-supported software:

| Software | Version |
| --- | --- |
| Composer | 2.9.3 |
| OpenSearch | 3.x (or Elasticsearch 8.x) |
| MariaDB | 11.4 |
| MySQL | 8.4 |
| nginx | 1.28 |
| PHP | 8.3, 8.4 |
| RabbitMQ | 4.1 |
| Redis | Valkey 8 (or Redis 7.2+) |
| Varnish | 7.7 |

### Bug fixes

Several issues have been resolved in this release:

- **Customer group extension attributes**
Fixed a plugin that was overwriting existing extension attributes instead of preserving them ([#53](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/pull/53))
- **Customer file attribute handling**
Prevents session files from being written to the filesystem for non-file customer attributes ([#174](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/pull/174))
- **Full Page Cache after login**
Resolved an issue where native FPC didn't work properly for logged in customers (AC-14999) ([#176](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/pull/176))
- **SRI hash failures**
Fixed Subresource Integrity hash failures that occurred when using JavaScript bundling and minification together ([#177](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/pull/177))
- **Plugin generation area order**
Fixed setup:di:compile to generate plugins in the correct area order, preventing frontend cache regeneration on first request ([#194](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/pull/194))
- **Mage-OS Page Builder Widgets module updated to 1.3.3**
    - Fixed css hiding other modal form labels ([#10](https://github.com/mage-os/module-page-builder-widget/pull/10))
    - Fixed virtualTypes on Block classes used by widgets ([#13](https://github.com/mage-os/module-page-builder-widget/pull/13))

### New features

#### Theme registration status command

A new CLI command helps developers identify themes that exist in the filesystem but are not registered in the database:

```bash
bin/magento theme:registration:status
```

This helps detect when theme changes require setup to be run, for zero-downtime deployment processes. ([#186](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/pull/186))

#### Queue configuration status command

A new CLI command detects inconsistencies in message queue configuration for both MySQL and AMQP (RabbitMQ/AmazonMQ) backends:

```bash
bin/magento queue:config:status
```

This helps detect when message queue changes require setup to be run, for zero-downtime deployment processes and health checks. ([#188](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/pull/188))

### Expanded database support

We've expanded database compatibility to better match real-world hosting environments:

- **MySQL:** 5.7, 8.0 through 8.4
- **MariaDB:** 10.2 through 10.11, and all 11.x versions

This gives you more flexibility in choosing your database server and makes upgrades smoother. ([#189](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/pull/189))
