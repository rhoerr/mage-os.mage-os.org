Last Friday we hosted an open community discussion about AI and what it means for Magento developers, agencies, and merchants. The conversation was wide-ranging, candid, and at times uncomfortably honest about how quickly day-to-day work is changing. The full recording is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oie5ZibcEGY); below is a recap of the themes that came up.

## The role shift: from developer to reviewer

Several participants described the same transition: where PhpStorm used to be open all day, Claude Code (or Cursor, Augment, Copilot, Codex) is now the default surface, and the human increasingly acts as a code reviewer rather than the primary author. It is happening fast — for some, the shift has compressed into a matter of weeks rather than months.

## Why Magento is well-positioned

A recurring point: Magento benefits disproportionately from AI tooling. Two reasons came up.

First, the platform has an unusually large public surface — DevDocs, Stack Exchange, years of community blog posts — which means modern foundation models already understand Magento well, often better than they understand smaller or younger frameworks.

Second, Magento's structure (modules, area scoping, DI, plugins, observers) gives agents natural boundaries to work within. Compared to greenfield projects where agents tend to introduce duplication and drift, agents working in a Magento codebase tend to stay closer to idiomatic patterns. As one participant put it: the structure of Magento is agent-friendly.

There was also a broader argument that platforms with *more code to write* benefit more from AI than SaaS platforms where the heavy lifting is hidden behind a vendor's API. Magento, with its open codebase and extension ecosystem, is exactly that kind of platform.

## What about juniors?

This was probably the most contested topic. Two views surfaced:

- Juniors should be kept away from AI because they cannot yet recognize when the model is producing bad code or bad patterns.
- AI is the single best tool a junior has ever had for *exploring* a large, intimidating codebase — and even when the model is fifty percent right, that is fifty percent more exploration than a junior would otherwise attempt.

A concrete anecdote: a first-year CS intern contributing to an e-commerce codebase via Claude Code and Cursor was able to participate at a depth that would have been hard to imagine a few years ago. The reviewer's job got harder, but the contributor's reach got significantly larger.

A more subtle observation: juniors who are comfortable with conversation and basic terminology tend to get further with these tools than those who approach them cautiously. The skill of *talking to the model well* is becoming part of the job.

## How people are actually using it

A quick snapshot of the tools mentioned:

- **Claude Code** — the most common default, often via the Max plan
- **Cursor / Augment / Copilot** — IDE-integrated agents
- **Code Rabbit** — automated first-pass code review on PRs
- **GitHub Codespaces** — used by some as a sandboxed environment for `--dangerously-skip-permissions` workflows
- **Agent Safe House** — a sandboxing setup adopted at Hyvä, took roughly four to six hours to set up and then disappears into the background
- **DDEV** — used by others to contain agent execution per project

There was also discussion of unsupervised agents that pick up small tickets and open PRs. One agency described a pipeline where merchant-filed issues are picked up by an agent, validated by end-to-end tests and code sniffers, and only then handed to a human for review. Several people are running variations of this on their own projects — for example, a daily GitHub Action that asks Claude to find one small thing to improve and open a PR for it.

The consistent rule across every setup: *human in the loop at the end*. Nothing merges or deploys without human eyes.

## Security and trust

Nobody on the call has a complete answer here, and that was openly acknowledged. The shared starting point: don't trust agent output, and don't trust anything that enters the model's context from outside — skills, MCP servers, web pages, copied documentation. Prompt injection is a real attack surface.

Approaches in active use:

- **Sandboxing** via Codespaces, Agent Safe House, DDEV containers, or local VMs
- **Skills review** — Hyvä maintains an internal skills repository where every external skill goes through both an AI-driven and a human security review before it can be used
- **Default distrust** — treat the agent like a chatty new developer whose work needs tasting before it goes out

The point was made that running `npx` against a random package is not meaningfully safer than running an agent skill from the internet. The discipline is the same, the surface is just larger now.

## Billing, costs, and the agency model

This is where opinions diverged most sharply.

Some agencies have notified clients that they are using Claude Code, that every line is human-reviewed, and have raised rates on the back of demonstrably faster turnaround. Clients have generally accepted this, especially when the speed gains are visible.

Other participants are seeing the opposite pressure: clients expecting roughly forty percent *less* cost because AI makes everyone faster. Independent freelancers in particular flagged the awkwardness of charging more when "you're not really writing the code anymore" — even though the productivity gain clearly justifies it on output.

There is also a longer-term concern: token costs may rise sharply (a 10× increase within six months was floated) once the current wave of VC subsidization ends. That makes token-efficiency, local models, and hybrid orchestration setups worth thinking about now rather than later.

The hourly-billing model in general is starting to creak. When productivity swings 50–1000% on the same hour of work, hours stop being a useful proxy for value delivered.

## Twelve months from now

The most concrete forward-looking prediction: within twelve months we may see a one-click path from "I want a store" to a running, dev-container Magento instance, possibly with one-click deploy to production. The implication is a flood of new Magento stores, including a lot of low-quality ones — the same dynamic that played out when game-development tools became accessible to everyone.

A more optimistic framing: even if the *ratio* of good to questionable stores stays the same, the absolute number of good stores grows substantially. And as cost of ownership comes down, Magento becomes more competitive again against Shopify for merchants who would otherwise have ruled it out.

For extension vendors, the picture is mixed. Building a decent clone of an existing extension is now a weekend project, which puts pressure on monolithic, do-everything modules. Small, purpose-built, well-maintained extensions look like the more durable shape — particularly ones that handle base capabilities so agencies and merchants can vibe-code their own customizations on top.

David Lambauer's recent talk came up here too: the long-term pitch against Shopify is increasingly about *data ownership and control*, not features. Features are cheap now. Owning your data, and being able to build whatever you want against it, is not.

A more speculative thread: as AI lowers the barrier to reading code, the historical role of the developer-as-scribe shifts. Whether that ends in some form of licensure or certification is open, but trust in the ecosystem will matter more, not less.

## What the community can do next

A few suggestions surfaced:

- **Centralize the conversation.** Useful discussion is currently scattered across LinkedIn, MageChat Slack, and various Discords. Pulling more of it into Mage-OS would make the knowledge accessible to the whole community.
- **Share working setups openly.** Sandboxing approaches, skill repositories, agent workflows — most of this is being figured out independently by every team.
- **Curate the noise.** As an ecosystem, helping merchants and developers understand which problems AI actually solves (and which it doesn't yet) is high-leverage right now.
- **Think about local models.** As token economics shift, having a hot-swap path to well-trained local models for parts of the workflow may matter sooner than expected.

## Closing

There is no neat conclusion to a conversation like this — the ground is moving too fast. The takeaway most people seemed to agree on: AI is here, it is staying, and Magento is unusually well-positioned to benefit from it *if* the community treats it the way it has treated every other big shift — openly, with shared tooling and shared standards.

Thanks to everyone who joined. We will be running more of these discussions, and we would like to host more of the AI conversation here in Mage-OS itself. If you would like to participate, get involved in the [tech meetings](/community) every Tuesday, or join the discussion on Discord.
