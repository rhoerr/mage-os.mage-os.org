On 2nd November 2023, our Dutch Chapter Mage-OS Netherlands organized the fantastic Meet Magento Netherlands event. It was sold out two weeks ahead, with over 300 enthusiasts participating. [Read the MM23NL recap](/?p=3117) written by Jisse Reitsma, part of the organizing team.

Despite the weather, the vibe was truly amazing and people within the Community were so happy to connect again. In his LinkedIn article titled “[Magento: Time for a Renaissance](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/time-magento-renaissance-jakub-winkler-ce2xf)”, Jakub Winkler expresses the positive energy that he felt again after many dark years and what he thinks contributed to it.

Hot off the press, you can now see the professional photos and recap video from the event!

## Engaging in proactive collaboration 

![Mathias and Vinai](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mathias-and-Vinai-1024x768.jpg)

In the last few months, Mage-OS participated in many Meet Magento events and got the opportunity to collect [feedback and questions](/?p=3013). Many of you have asked for clarity on how we relate to Magento Association, and what it all means for this ecosystem.

On the Monday after Meet Magento Netherlands, Vinai and Mathias Schreiber met to discuss goals alignment and opportunities for collaboration. [Here is the recap co-written by Vinai and Mathias](/?p=3231) on what came out of this first meeting.

To strengthen our focus and not dilute the energy of volunteers who contribute actively to our working groups, we felt it was important to look at current roles and responsibilities between Mage-OS and the Magento Association and how we can best collaborate. 

Here are some things that we see are specific to the Magento Association: 

- Work with Adobe to strengthen Magento Open Source and grow the understanding of the value of Open Source within the corporate environment

- Grow the community through Meet Magento events organization, support and promotion

- Manage Magento Open Source contributors by building the Community Council

We are delighted that the Magento Association has already launched a brand new **meet-magento.com** website, and are hard at work with the **magento-opensource.com** website. We’re exploring whether that site could leverage some of the content our content group and others have planned and written over the last two years.

On the Mage-OS end, we keep focusing on:

- Community growth and engagement: we gather more people and bring magic to events, we widen the community's footprint on social media, carrying our positive, open and inclusive values everywhere we go

- Product enhancement: improve our infrastructure so that
  - the platform is easy and cost effective to maintain
  - it is rewarding for Magento community members to enrich it with creativity, innovation and Magento mastery

- Product long term support: we plan to set up a commercial entity and provide long term support to the Mage-OS eCommerce platform for merchants of all shapes and sizes.

## Let’s catch up at the following Magento events!
