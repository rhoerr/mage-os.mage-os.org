This season has been packed with Magento events, all reflecting the community’s dedication to innovation, open collaboration, and a bright future for Magento Open Source. Here’s a look at recent highlights:

- **Meet Magento NYC**: This event brought together developers, merchants, and Adobe representatives, emphasizing Magento Open Source’s strategic importance within Adobe. Attendees enjoyed updates on deployment processes and community-led initiatives for the platform.  
    

- **MageTitans Groningen**: The Netherlands welcomed back MageTitans after a five-year break, featuring technical talks and community networking. Key highlights included MageWire Version 3, payment integration with Hyvä Checkout, and discussions on career growth within the Magento ecosystem.

**Upcoming Event**: [**Meet Magento Netherlands**](https://nl.meet-magento.com/) is just around the corner on **October 31**! Stay tuned for event photos, updates, and takeaways across our social media channels.

## **Content and Community Initiatives**

**Trade Shows and Magento Marketing** In our push to elevate Magento Open Source’s profile, we discussed the importance of trade show presence. To manage budgets effectively, we’re exploring shared booth spaces and additional channels to increase Magento's visibility. Our SEO strategies include encouraging partner agencies to link back to Magento Open Source.

**Membership Badge** A Magento Association membership badge is in development! This badge will allow members to show their affiliation proudly on their websites. Check out the MageOS membership and compatibility badges too!

**Web Accessibility & ADA Compliance** With accessibility in mind, we’ve started an ADA/EAA audit to address contrast issues and ensure compliance with upcoming 2025 EU standards.  With that opportunity, we’re considering a shift away from the current WordPress theme to a simpler, more accessible design that will streamline updates. Additionally, the Italian version of the website is underway, and we’re aiming for a smooth language transition soon.

## **Development Progress**

**Mage-OS Version 1.0.5** is nearing release, led by Vinai and Fabrizio. The team is actively preparing for the launch, with the new version expected to be available soon.

**Admin Theme Revamp** Progress continues on the revamped admin theme, with a focus on Stores > Settings improvements. Updates to widgets, the page builder, and media gallery elements are nearly complete, thanks to the hard work from Artem..

**AI-Driven Backend Assistant** Our AI initiatives are gaining momentum! Ryan Sun presented a proof of concept for an AI-driven backend assistant designed to support merchants with real-time help. Additionally, a catalog translation extension from Davide Lunardon and Samuele is set for launch on Mage-OS Labs.

**Search and Indexing Enhancements** We’re implementing fixes for Magento’s search suggestions to avoid zero-result issues and working on improvements to the indexing framework. With Jakub and Ivan’s collaboration, these indexing updates aim to support large catalog stores with better performance and scalability.

**DevDocs and SEO Improvements** Documentation is a priority this month, with Nikola refining the developer docs by addressing broken links and enhancing installation guides. SEO efforts also include footer updates and strategies to boost MageOS.org’s search ranking.

**Merge Conflicts & Branch Protection** We tackled ongoing merge conflicts by testing solutions to avoid recurring issues, with Ryan and the team adjusting squash merges and branch protection rules. We’re also exploring ways to manage the protected 2.4-develop-upstream branch.
