For years, our agency website was a bit like that old rag rug everyone has—a collection of patches and mismatched pieces that somehow managed to hold together while somehow getting the job done.  
It had evolved into something it wasn't originally intended for and served as both a playground for junior developers testing out new ideas and a real-life training ground for experimental tech. While we embraced the chaos (and learned a lot about performance optimization – some of our current Magento extensions started their lives on that site!), it was clear that our online presence needed an upgrade.

We cherished the memories and lessons, but it was time to transition to something more powerful and modern – **a platform worthy of showcasing our expertise in eCommerce and** aligning better with our evolving business, specifically expanding into selling Magento extensions**.**

## Time to Move to Something Better: Magento!

We jumped into the project with the kind of enthusiasm usually reserved for pizza on a Friday night, ready to build on the most robust eCommerce platform out there, the tech stack we happily use in our client projects since more than 10 years:

**Magento, of course!** – and pair it with the lightning-fast, **cutting-edge [Hyvä Theme](https://www.hyva.io/)**.

Easy peasy, right? Wrong!  
Building our own site as an agency proved to be one of the toughest challenges we faced!

It’s like trying to renovate your house while still living in it – client projects and urgent deadlines always jumped the queue, leaving our own site languishing on the back burner. It became the forgotten project, the website equivalent of that one sock that always goes missing in the laundry.

## Mage-OS – A New E-Commerce Star Was Born

Just when our internal Magento project was gasping for air amidst the constant demands of client work, **Mage-OS** entered the scene , shining like a beacon of hope (and open-source awesomeness!) and reignited our passion for this project. 

We were instantly hooked, this **community-driven, innovative platform**, was _made_ for Magento developers like us, the kind of folks who get excited about **exploring new frontiers in eCommerce**.  
Perfect for agencies like us that are obsessed with **delivering high-performing and user-friendly online experiences for our clients**.

The decision was clear: we'd put our Magento project on a new footing with Mage-OS and dive back into development with renewed enthusiasm!

**Switching from Magento to Mage-OS? Smoother than a baby's bottom!  
**Seriously, it was surprisingly easy. We had a couple of tiny hiccups – a quick fix for Magewire (which we were thrilled to contribute to – open source FTW!) and a minor tweak in one of our extensions – but overall, the transition was a breeze.

Today, we can proudly say we're **[the very first Mage-OS store](https://www.jajuma.de/en/jajuma-shop/demo-shop-with-mage-os-and-hyva-themes)** – a testament to our dedication to eCommerce innovation and a big high-five to the **exciting future of open-source based online retail**!

## Cool! It Just Works With Mage-OS...

Using Mage-OS for our own site was the perfect opportunity to put our extensions through their paces. Yes, we're those guys who "eat their own dog food" (metaphorically speaking, of course!) and use our own products.  
We validated the compatibility of _all_ our extensions on Mage-OS – zero issues! – and even set up the first public **demo for Mage-OS**: mage-os.extension.jajuma.de.

We're honored to be the **first extension provider with official Mage-OS support** – a tradition we're proud of. (Remember, we were also the first to offer Hyvä support – we like being pioneers!).

## Going Live as the Very First Mage-OS Store!

In early April 2024, we finally completed our fun and exciting project and launched our new homepage, **proudly becoming the very first live store on Mage-OS**. 

Throughout this journey, we learned a great deal and developed a genuine appreciation for Mage-OS (and don’t worry, Magento still holds a special place in our hearts!). 

**We remain truly impressed by the dedication of the Mage-OS team and their commitment to community-driven eCommerce — a slogan that perfectly encapsulates the spirit of Mage-OS.**

## Looking Forward: The Future is Bright with Both Magento and Mage-OS!

Our biggest takeaway? Switching from Magento to Mage-OS is surprisingly simple, and **working with Mage-OS is just as awesome as working with Magento**. 

If you're a tech-savvy merchant looking for something new and innovative, **Mage-OS is definitely worth considering**. 

Even if you’re not ready to make the full switch yet, keep Mage-OS on your radar – **it's evolving into a robust, community-supported platform with huge potential**.

**Magento merchants, meet your new superpower: freedom of choice!  
**In this fast-paced world of eCommerce, being independent, having options and full control is key. With Mage-OS around, you now have the freedom to choose:  
Build your business on the proven flexibility and power of Magento, the reliable workhorse.  
Or leverage the community-driven, innovative game-changer Mage-OS on top of the rock-solid reliability of Magento you know and love.  
Either way, always with free license for life, always owning your data, while scaling and growing with no limits and staying independent.  
**It's definitely a more resilient strategy than giving up all your freedom and control by putting all your eggs in one basket with Shopify!**

P.S.: One thing hasn't changed with our new site—we’re still using it as a testing ground for innovative ideas, cutting-edge tech, and breakthrough solutions.
