## **Content and Community Initiatives**

The **Magento Association Marketing Team** is experiencing significant growth, with ongoing onboarding efforts. New team members are being assigned responsibilities for **social media management** and **content scheduling**. To ensure better organization, Laura has been appointed as the **marketing team’s board liaison**, helping to establish a clearer structure and delegation of responsibilities.

In an effort to maintain focus, the team discussed ensuring that **MageOS Discord** remains dedicated to **MageOS-specific discussions**, rather than becoming a general support channel for **Magento Open Source**.

A new initiative aims to facilitate knowledge sharing within the community. Once a month, the team plans to regroup and share **best practices**, such as **marketing strategies for Magento agencies**, as previously initiated within the **Lady Magento group**.

Finally, the **Monday content meetings** won't take place anymore, but the team remains open to discussions and collaboration via Discord.

## **Development Progress**

The Mage-OS team has made significant progress in various areas, including the **Mage-OS Dashboard Migration**, now live at [dashboard.mage-os.org](https://dashboard.mage-os.org). We are also transitioning to **[Taiga](https://tree.taiga.io/project/mage-os-mage-os-technical-initiatives/kanban)** for improved task tracking, where the document will now

In preparation for the upcoming **Mage-OS 1.1 Release (#45)**, package bundling is being reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The **Creatuity Compiled Interceptors** are under consideration for inclusion but require bug fixes before integration. The **Admin Theme** is confirmed for the release, but its timing depends on the release of **Magento 2.4.8** on April 8 and development progress.

Several ongoing developments are in the works. David has taken over the **Reservations Grid (#34)** enhancements, and the **EcomScan Actions (#35)** still face an issue with license key retrieval, with investigations ongoing. Nikola provided valuable insights into the **DevDocs Infrastructure**, explaining how documentation is built and stored. For **OpenTofu (#37)**, the repository name will remain **mage-os/terraform** to avoid potential risks, and it is now ready to be merged.

A **Gitpod Cleanup** was also completed, with an old setup being archived while the team continues with the newer version ([GitHub link](https://github.com/mage-os/magento-gitpod)). Additionally, the team is considering switching to **OpenTofu** for Terraform compliance with open-source standards, with David leading the initiative.

The **Admin AI Assistant (#19)** saw a demo of a tool that executes SQL queries and returns results. **Magento Version Compatibility (#41)** is another focus area, with Ryan Hoerr having developed a solution currently undergoing testing. The **AI Catalog Translation Extension (#32)** faces an issue with **URL rewrite generation**, which is being addressed. Furthermore, a proposal has been made to create a webpage listing **Mage-OS Modules Promotion (#43)**, categorizing stable modules separately from those needing testing to increase adoption and engagement.
