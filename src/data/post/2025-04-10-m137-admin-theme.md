We’re excited to announce a major milestone for the Mage-OS community: [Artem](https://www.linkedin.com/in/artem-kozynets) has officially [released](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/artem-kozynets_github-mage-os-labtheme-adminhtml-m137-activity-7315480759618736128-Tpft?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABUaYtIBKBOe9-aESwhKh4_njhnvo98UZxQ) the **Admin Theme for Mage-OS**, bringing a fresh, modern look to the Magento-derived platform's admin panel.

That’s right: the brand-new **Admin Theme** is live — and it’s a game changer for the Magento 2.4, Adobe Commerce, or Mage-OS admin panel. It’s clean. It’s modern. And the best part? You can install it today with just a few Composer commands!

### This is Artem’s Work — and It’s Outstanding

This entire effort is the result of Artem’s initiative, creativity, and expertise. Developed in his personal time, the Admin Theme reflects his long-standing commitment to the Magento ecosystem and Mage-OS community. It’s a testament to what individuals can achieve when they care deeply about the platform and its future.

His contribution doesn’t just provide a better user experience — it raises the bar for what Mage-OS can offer. And it’s a great reminder that anyone in the community can help move things forward, just like Artem has.

### What’s the theme all about?

- **Fresh new look** for the admin panel

- Better **contrast**, **typography**, and **layout**

- A faster, more comfortable experience for merchants, devs, support folks — anyone who lives in the backend

- Fully open source, lightweight, and works out of the box with Mage-OS (and Magento 2.4+)

- **Compatible with Mage-OS 1.0 and 1.1**

- **Compatible with Magento 2.4**

- **Usable with Adobe Commerce 2.4** (but compatibility with Commerce features not guaranteed)

Install it with:

```
composer require mage-os/theme-adminhtml-m137bin/magento setup:upgrade
```

### A Clean, Modern UX for the Admin Panel

The Admin Theme delivers a sleek, professional interface that stays true to the spirit of Magento while pushing its visual design into the modern era. Clear typography, improved color contrast, and a refined layout make the admin experience more pleasant and productive for developers, merchants, and support teams alike.

Screenshots shared by early adopters show a crisp and visually balanced UI that dramatically improves the feel of the default admin dashboard—while remaining lightweight and compatible with Mage-OS out of the box.

### Why This Matters

As Mage-OS continues to gain traction as a community-driven fork of Magento Open Source, having high-quality frontend and backend experiences is key to encouraging adoption. Artem’s work provides exactly that: a more intuitive and aesthetically pleasing admin interface, built by someone deeply embedded in the Magento and Mage-OS ecosystem.

The **Admin Theme + Switcher** simplifies the testing and adoption process by letting you switch between the old and new theme directly from the admin panel—great for agencies, theme developers, and site maintainers.

The [**M137 Design System**](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1486802857979032188/m137-design-system-and-ui-kit) lets you design your own admin components and mockups easily in Figma.

### Powered by Community — and You Can Help

Both the theme and the switcher module are part of the **Mage-OS Lab**, an open-source space for experimentation and innovation. They’re free to use, open to contributions, and designed to encourage collaboration.

Work like this is only possible thanks to individual contributors like Artem — and through the support of our **Mage-OS Partners** and members. Their backing helps fund infrastructure, coordination, and initiatives that directly benefit the community.

If you're passionate about Magento or Mage-OS, consider contributing — whether it’s code, design, testing, or financial support. Everyone can play a role.

### Get Involved

Both the theme and switcher module are open source under the Mage-OS Lab umbrella. If you're using Mage-OS, consider giving the new theme a try and providing feedback. Contributions, pull requests, and issue reports are more than welcome.

With contributions like this, Mage-OS continues to evolve as a flexible, modern, and community-centric ecommerce platform. Hats off to Artem for helping move the ecosystem forward in such a visible and valuable way.

If you like what you see, consider supporting the Mage-OS project. Financial contributions don’t just keep the lights on—they enable visible progress, boost morale, and encourage more developers to step forward with their own ideas.
