Welcome to our August progress update! Here’s what’s been happening recently around Mage-OS:

## Content

### Frontend Options Page

We published a page covering frontend options available for Magento! This includes the built-in theme and variations; major alternatives; headless; and more.

Check it out: [https://mage-os.org/why-magento/features/front-end-options/](/product/features)

[![Frontend Options Page Screenshot](~/assets/images/blog/2023/Mage-OS-Frontend-Options-1024x641.png)](https://mage-os.org/why-magento/features/front-end-options/)

The community response has been great! Several more vendors have reached out about the list, and we are more than keen to include them and show the breadth and depth of the ecosystem. If you have another frontend system you’d like to include, let us know through the [contact form](/contact) or on [Discord](http://chat.mage-os.org/).

### Magento Developer Documentation (devdocs.mage-os.org)

Check out our developer documentation, if you haven’t already! [devdocs.mage-os.org](https://devdocs.mage-os.org)

[![Mage-OS Dev Docs Search Screenshot](~/assets/images/blog/2023/Mage-OS-Dev-Docs-Screenshot-1024x641.png)](https://devdocs.mage-os.org/docs/)

Since last month, contributors have added and reviewed 80,000 words with the help of AI! It also has a powerful and quick search, powered by Algolia for Open Source.

Huge thanks to David Lambauer for leading and pushing the documentation forward.

The new documentation is getting indexed by search engines, so be on the lookout for Mage-OS devdocs results on your next searches!

It’s [super easy to edit and submit changes on Github](https://github.com/mage-os/devdocs), so if you have some time, maybe add your expertise to the docs as well!

## Technical

[Magento](https://helpx.adobe.com/uk/security/products/magento/apsb23-42.html) security updates were released earlier this month, and are also available on our public Magento mirror! [mirror.mage-os.org](https://mirror.mage-os.org/) 

The new versions are:

- 2.4.6-p2

- 2.4.5-p4

- 2.4.4-p5

The technical contribution team is focused on finalizing the details and process for our very own Mage-OS Distribution, as well as a number of special features for inclusion. More to come!

## Membership

We are in the process of finalizing arrangements with an accounting firm. Because we are an international not-for-profit organization, strict identification and tax rules apply and have to be diligently followed. The unusual nature of our association and international membership have proven tricky for navigating legal and financial arrangements, but we hope to get this all worked out very soon.

If you want to start budgeting for next year, here are the [Sponsorship Tiers](https://opencollective.com/mage-os) we are looking at.

As soon as we are ready to collect funds, we’ll let you know via Discord, our [newsletter](/community), and on [social media](https://linkedin.com/company/mage-os).

## Events

### First ever Mage-OS Hackathon!

Würzburg, Germany, 7-8th September

15 or so experienced and talented developers are participating in the upcoming Mage-OS Hackathon, including people from Basecom, Integer\_Net, and Hyvä. Huge thanks to [run\_as\_root](https://run-as-root.sh/) for organizing and hosting this at their headquarter offices.

If you’re interested, there is still time to join! Make history in allowing the Mage-OS Distribution to reach a new milestone before general availability.

### MageUnconference Germany

Cologne, Germany, 29th September – 1st October

If you enjoyed [Mage Unconference Netherlands](https://yireo.com/blog/2023-07-19-mage-unconference-aftermath) back in July, or were sad to miss it, consider joining for Magento Unconference (MageUC), the first of its kind in Germany!

Unconferences are a laid back and informal alternative to conferences, where none of the talks are selected in advance, and the conversations and breaks are the focus.

### Meet Magento New York

New York, USA, 10-11th October

Coming up soon is the premiere event for the northeast, Meet Magento New York! Many of our US-based representatives will be there, including Ryan Hoerr, Laura Folco, Damien Retzinger, and many more.

The event will span two full days this year, packed with sessions, panels, and conversation. We’ll be there to share our vision for the future of Magento, and we hope you’ll be there to chip in.

If you’re a merchant interested in attending, you can contact us for a 50% discount code. The event is also still open for sponsorships. Don’t wait to reserve your spot!
