### **From Accidental Magento Developer to Community Builder**

[Francis M. Gallagher’](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francismgallagher/)s journey into the world of Magento, and later Mage-OS, began almost by accident. In 2012, while still fresh out of university, Francis was looking for a new direction after an early success in anime streaming ran into legal trouble. A friend mentioned a job opening for a Magento developer. Although he had never worked with Magento before, his years of coding since age fourteen gave him the confidence to try.

At the interview, the hiring team knew little about PHP or Magento, so he wrote his own interview questions and tasks, passing “with flying colors”. Within his first two weeks he launched two small Magento sites and quickly proved his talent. What started as a junior developer role soon became a career that moved through agencies and well-known retailers such as Oh Polly and Trespass.

### **Finding a Home in the Magento Community**

Francis quickly discovered that Magento was more than just an e-commerce platform, it was a vibrant community. In the early days he sought help in IRC channels, but before long he was the one providing it. He became an “OP”, essentially a Slack-style administrator, and found a professional home.

Other frameworks he worked with, such as Laravel or Drupal, never gave him the same sense of belonging. Magento’s culture of openness and collaboration kept him engaged and inspired.

### **Mage-OS: A New Chapter**

When Adobe’s stewardship of Magento created uncertainty, the open-source community rallied. In 2021, an open letter to Adobe helped spark Mage-OS, a community-driven fork and incubator for innovation. For Francis, who had long relied on Magento’s vibrant community for support and growth, Mage-OS felt like a natural continuation of the values he cherished: openness, collaboration, and grassroots empowerment.

He immediately recognized its potential and committed to supporting this “new invigorated part of the community”. Mage-OS aims to nurture grassroots development and provide a platform where contributors can rely on the association’s technical and marketing muscle. Francis describes it as an “incubator” for open-source projects: a place where developers can build freely, get feedback from experienced peers, and see their work gain visibility and adoption.

_Note from Mage-OS: We truly welcome anyone with fresh ideas or a passion for Magento to reach out, get involved, and explore how we can help bring those ideas to life._

### **Challenges and Opportunities**

For Francis, the greatest challenge in community projects is not generating ideas but turning them into action. People often bring excellent concepts, but few have the time or confidence to carry them forward. He stresses the need for _psychological safety_, a culture where contributors can experiment, fail, and learn without fear.

Marketing and visibility are also recurring concerns. Many developers outside Mage-OS’s inner circle are unaware of its ongoing work because they rarely check Discord, LinkedIn, or the project’s website. Francis advocates for more frequent, bite-sized updates and grassroots events to keep the wider community engaged. 

### **Grassroots Events and Local Engagement**

Francis believes smaller, local meet-ups are key to sustaining excitement between major annual conferences. He envisions informal gatherings (pizza, beer, and lightning talks) similar to the meet-ups organized by the Umbraco community. These events lower the barrier to entry, allowing developers and small agencies to network and share ideas without the high costs of big conferences.

_We would be happy if community members volunteered to organize such events at the local level. Anyone interested can reach out directly through the Mage-OS Discord to get support and connect with others._

Such grassroots engagement, he argues, is how Mage-OS can remain visible, attract new contributors, and ensure that the spirit of Magento’s open-source heritage thrives.

### **Looking Ahead**

Francis M. Gallagher’s story reflects the evolution of the Magento ecosystem itself: from scrappy beginnings to a mature, collaborative network of professionals. His commitment to Mage-OS demonstrates how individuals can shape the future of open source, not just through code, but by fostering community, encouraging innovation, and creating spaces where others can grow.

As Mage-OS continues to expand, Francis’ vision of transparent governance, strong community support, and grassroots connection offers a roadmap for how open-source projects can remain vibrant and relevant for years to come.
