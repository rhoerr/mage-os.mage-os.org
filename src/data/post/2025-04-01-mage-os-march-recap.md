## **Meet Magento France**

Meet Magento France 2025 was a resounding success and a landmark moment for the Magento ecosystem in France. Held on March 25 at the Étoile Business Center in Paris, the inaugural event gathered over 350 participants from across Europe, including merchants, developers, agencies, and technology partners. For [Thien-Lan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thienlan/), participating in Meet Magento France 2025 was especially meaningful, as it brought the Magento community together in her hometown—a place where she was born, raised, and began her professional journey.

The sold-out edition radiated energy, innovation, and community spirit. From visionary keynotes by leaders to technical deep-dives and strategic sessions, attendees were treated to a day rich in insights and inspiration. Beyond the talks, the event celebrated its open-source DNA with strong representation from [Magento Open Source](https://magento-opensource.com/), Adobe Commerce, Mage-OS and many more offering something for everyone. The organizers—led by Camille Bénard and supported by an all-star team—created a vibrant, unforgettable experience, topped off with lively networking, a cocktail party, and even an afterparty for the night owls. This first-ever Meet Magento France didn’t just meet expectations—it set a new standard for community-driven events in the ecosystem.

### Tech Updates

We started strong:

- **Terraform to OpenTofu** migration wrapped up smoothly.

- **Reservations Grid** got a facelift thanks to [David Tabatadze](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-tabatadze-981055213/) (who powered through even while recovering from surgery—hero move ).

- **New Admin Theme** is nearly done. Artem squashed the bugs and made it 1.1-ready.

And in the background, **AI tools** kept getting sharper. The backend assistant now runs on multiple models, executes SQL, and is waiting for its own Lab repo.

### GitHub Drama

Mid-month, everything vanished—**Mage-OS GitHub orgs were flagged**. No access. No explanation. Just... 404s.

The community rallied: backups were made, mirrors tested, GitHub tickets opened.  
Eventually, the orgs were cleared. It was a spam false-positive. No apology, but we’re back online and stronger for it. (Also, shoutout to everyone who kept cool during the blackout) It was a wake-up call about how much we rely on third-party services. We're now actively exploring backup strategies and alternative plans to be better prepared if something like this happens again.

##### CMS, SEO, and Smarter Widgets

[Davide Lunardon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davide-lunardon-b78813a1/) explored integrating **GrapesJS**, but pivoted after discovering Magento CMS widgets are trickier than they look. Now, he's building a more powerful "CMS Widget" component instead—with previews and repeatable fields.

Meanwhile, [Samuele](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuele-martini-02820795/) dropped a module for **meta robots control** (think: noindex, nofollow)—now ready for testing.

##### Prepping for Mage-OS 1.1

The big 1.1 release is brewing. We’re syncing with Magento 2.4.8 and lining up features:

- New Admin Theme

- Optional Creatuity interceptor module

- Possibly even a revamped web installer  
    Testing and merges are ramping up in April.
