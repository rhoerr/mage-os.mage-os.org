We are excited to announce the release of Mage-OS Distribution 1.3.1, another step in the building of the definitive open source e-commerce platform!

Mage-OS 1.3.1 is built on Magento Open Source 2.4.8-p2, and **includes an important security update** from Magento Open Source that was released just this morning.

This update fixes vulnerability CVE-2025-54236, by applying the official Adobe security patch to Mage-OS. There are no other changes from Mage-OS 1.3.0.

Security Bulletin: [APSB25-88](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/magento/apsb25-88.html)  
Magento Security Patch: [Action Required: Critical Security Update Available for Adobe Commerce  (APSB25-88)](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-cloud-kcs/kbarticles/ka-27397)

**Please update any Mage-OS instances to version 1.3.1 as soon as possible to prevent security issues.**

```
composer require mage-os/product-community-edition:1.3.1
bin/magento setup:upgrade
```

If you have Magento or Adobe Commerce, you will need to apply the Adobe security patch available through the link above.

## Want to participate?

Are you interested in contributing to Mage-OS, or have a bug or improvement you’d like to make? **We welcome pull requests** at [https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2)!

If you have a bigger project in mind, please [join Discord](http://chat.mage-os.org/) and chat about your idea. We’d be delighted to hear from you, and help figure out how your idea best fits into Mage-OS!

## Installing Mage-OS

You can create a new Mage-OS project with the following SSH command:

```
composer create-project --repository-url=https://repo.mage-os.org/ mage-os/project-community-edition .
```

After a successful composer download, you will need to run the installer. Please see [DevDocs: Installation Guide for Mage-OS](https://devdocs.mage-os.org/docs/main)

## Moving to Mage-OS

If you are already using Magento 2.4 and PHP 8.2+, you can change to Mage-OS by running the following in SSH:

```
composer config repositories.0 composer https://repo.mage-os.org/ &&
    composer require mage-os/product-community-edition --no-update &&
    composer remove magento/product-community-edition magento/composer-dependency-version-audit-plugin magento/composer-root-update-plugin --no-update &&
    composer remove sebastian/comparator --dev --no-update &&
    composer update --no-plugins --with-all-dependencies
```

We strongly recommend updating to the latest Magento version (currently 2.4.8) before changing to Mage-OS, to minimize issues.

Your specific situation may require additional changes to your `composer.json` file. Generally this will involve changing `magento/` package names to `mage-os/`, or updating dependency versions.
