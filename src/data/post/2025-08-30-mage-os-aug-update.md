## **Community & Events**

Conference season is right around the corner! The first stop is [**Meet Magento Ukraine on September 4**](https://ua.meet-magento.com/en/), an excellent chance to connect with fellow Mage-OS contributors, merchants, and community members. We’d love to see you there.

And this is just the beginning, **more community events are scheduled in the coming weeks**. Take a look at our [events calendar](/events), join in, share your insights, and be part of strengthening the Mage-OS ecosystem.

## **Technical Progress**

## **Mage-OS 1.3.0 Release**

We’re happy to announce that **Mage-OS Distribution 1.3.0** is officially out! Built on Magento Open Source 2.4.8-p2, it includes all upstream updates as well as community-driven fixes.

Highlights of this release:

- **Foundation:** Based on Magento Open Source 2.4.8-p2 with all upstream updates.

- **Recommended stack:** Composer 2.8, OpenSearch 2.19, MariaDB 11.4 / MySQL 8.4, PHP 8.4 or 8.3, RabbitMQ 4, Valkey 8 (or Redis 7.2+), Varnish 7.6, Apache 2.4, nginx 1.26.

- **Backend theme updates:** Freshened icons, cleaner newsletter and email template views, optimized data grids and modals, improved media galleries, refactored URL rewrites, and better LESS configuration.

- **Bug fixes:** Addressed JavaScript errors, improved integration tests, enhanced LESS handling, and expanded city validation rules.  
    

A big thank you goes to all contributors: Artem Kozynets, Bhushan Kumar, Fabrizio Balliano, Lucas van Staden, Ryan Hoerr, Simon Humeau (Antadis), Vinai Kopp, Vova Yatsyuk, and many others for making this release happen.

## **Project Archiving**

To bring more clarity to active projects, the **Web Installer** and **Backup Module** have been archived.

- **Why:** Lack of maintenance and unresolved issues, never reaching a stable release.

- **Note:** Any project can be revived if a maintainer steps up.

- **Goal:** Reduce clutter and highlight what’s actively maintained.

## **New Module: Theme Optimization**

We’re happy to introduce the **Theme Optimization Module** by Ryan.

- Delivers smooth **page transitions** on both frontend and backend for a faster, more polished user experience.

- Already included in Mage-OS packages and listed in the community directory.

- Future plans include possible **BFCache support** to make browsing even faster.

## **Mage-OS 2.0 – Coming in October**

Work continues on **Mage-OS 2.0**, targeted for October 2025. Our release strategy is to provide **two major updates per year**, independent of Adobe Magento’s cycle.

Candidate modules being considered:

- Meta Robots Tag

- Theme Optimization

- Potential AI-related tools

We’re also debating how to package Mage-OS best:

- A **full bundle** with many features included.

- A **lean core** with add-ons available as needed.

- Or even multiple “flavors” (minimal vs. full-featured) generated through a custom installer.

What do you think?

## **Technical Work in Progress**

Ryan is working on **independent module versioning** to give more modular control. This will:

- Simplify maintenance.

- Allow cleaner, more flexible updates.
