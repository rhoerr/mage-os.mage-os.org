## **Content**

**Theme Issues:** Our current theme is limiting post creation for initiative pages. We’re working on code fixes to remove unwanted elements like dates and authors.

**WordPress Community:** Temporary suspension of automatic plugin/theme updates due to community disruptions. We’re monitoring the situation.

**Partner Page:** Updating sponsor logos for partner pages with gold, silver, and bronze backgrounds, but progress has been slowed by technical issues.

**Community Involvement**Your voice matters! Join our upcoming meetings and contribute to shaping the future of Mage-OS. We’re aiming for strong community participation after the summer break!

## **Development Progress**

**Mage-OS Store Launch:** The first live stores, [Traktor Servis](https://www.traktor-servis.hr/) store created by [Inchoo](https://inchoo.net/) (who are proud Mage-Os members). And [Jajuma](https://www.jajuma.de/en) store, both feature custom functionalities using Mage-OS and Hyvä. A [case study](https://inchoo.net/work/traktor-servis/) was created about Traktor Servis by Inchoo.

**Web Installer Progress:** We're 99% done! Kudos to Jakub Winkler for leading this important project.

**Magento**: Magento has a security update coming out 8 Oct, we've started preparing repositories for it.

**Admin Theme Overhaul:** Significant progress has been made on the new admin theme. The Customer section is complete, and the Marketing section is next!

**AI Backend Assistant:** Ryan Sun is developing an AI-driven assistant to simplify Magento’s backend tasks, improving usability for new merchants.

**Search Suggestion Fixes:** A new patch by Ryan Sun will improve Magento 2’s search suggestions, addressing the “zero results” issue.
