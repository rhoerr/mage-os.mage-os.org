Please expect these updates will be less polished but more frequent than our prior posts.\n\n## Technical topics\n\n### Package generation\n\nWe are continuing to work on the package splitting functionality. A reference implementation regarding the general package generation is complete. We are building multiple implementations using different languages in order to increase the bus-factor. Noteworthy is that all mage-os composer packages will have stable checksums. We are close to being able to create a mirror distribution, but are still missing:\n\n1. The composer.json file for the magento/magento2-base package. The question of how to get a base package composer.json is solved, but not yet implemented. More information on why that isn’t straight forward and what is required can be found in a [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VFFL7JbsUV0MUVZE_1ojCPRI9F4ZZtema1_cOgreNDo/edit?usp=sharing).  \n   A public repository with all relevant composer.json files can be found at  \n   [github.com/mage-os/magento2-base-composer-json](https://github.com/mage-os/magento2-base-composer-json)\n2. The meta-package and project-package generation.\n\nWe expect the meta- and project-package composer.json generation to be simpler than the base-package composer.json and intend to complete these tasks until the next meeting, at least with the JavaScript package splitter implementation.\n\n### Preparing the GitHub organization for being open to the public\n\nWe discussed how to handle write privileges to the repositories and who will implement the necessary configuration.\n\n## Organizational topics\n\n### Magento Open Source Marketing Content Creation\n\n- Since Adobe has effectively removed next to all content on the brand Magento and shut down the magento.com domain, we feel it is super urgent to provide an alternative portal where merchants can inform themselves about Magento Open Source.\n- Until that exists, a lot of companies who have built their business around Magento Open Source are suffering from Adobe’s decision to redirect magento.com to their Adobe commerce landing page.\n- We decided to reach out to individuals in the community asking for help in creating content. Feature descriptions, key value propositions and case studies are the most important.\n- Once we have a reasonable amount of content compiled, we will set up a website.\n- We want to do this independently of the Magento Association and Adobe since they probably will take a lot more time to get it done. And we think time is of essence.\n- If a better website is set up later under a better domain, we will be happy to share or hand over any Magento Open Source marketing content that is relevant to merchants. We are very willing to collaborate, but do not want to wait idle.\n\n### Magento Open Source STS\n\nThe biggest topic was news shared by Adobe at the Open Source Task Force meeting that they intend to create a Magento Open Source Short Term Support (STS) distribution, which would run in parallel with a LTS version.\n\nThis is amazing good news if it is realized. Adobe offered to share their build processes and tools as part of this.\n\nWe welcome this wholeheartedly, but at the same time feel it is very important to continue on our path to create independent distributions, since we all have experienced the time it takes for things in big companies to happen. We want to move faster.\n\nOnce the STS release exists, all the work we will have done can benefit it.\n\nRight now, the STS version of Magento is a proposal, and many things are still unclear or not yet decided on. It is a very positive outlook, but we’re cautious to celebrate too early.\n\nThank you,\n\n_The whole Mage-OS team_","src/data/post/2022-02-11-week-5-and-6-of-2022.md","4bace812dbf15e1a",{"html":47,"metadata":48},"\u003Cp>Every Tuesday we have a meeting to discuss technical topics, and every Wednesday we have a meeting regarding organizational topics.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is the first post of the new bi-weekly status updates we will be publishing to be more transparent regarding the work we are doing.

Apart from updates on social media and conferences/discussion panels we haven’t communicated much publicly.\n\nThis will finally change today. You may expect regular updates from us, in short or long form. Even if there is little to report on, we will let you know what is being worked on.\n\nThere are a couple of things we would like to update you on, and tell you what happened over the course of the past four months.\n\n### There was a lot of talking\n\nWhen we wrote our letter, it came from concerns around the future of Magento Open Source. There was no clear direction on the Open Source product, especially compared to the amount of communication and marketing around Adobe Commerce.\n\nThe community seemed to be slipping away, vanishing into the dark. We believe, in retrospect, that this is the result of two things:\n\n- Leadership at Adobe changed and core members with strategic positions left. There was no replacement for these figures and a lack of business case for further investment into Open Source.\n- A growing disconnect between Adobe and the Community has risen, as a result of dissatisfaction around the Open Source contribution model, a lack of communication and a lack of a clear roadmap\n\nWe very much believe these two factors played into each other and created a downward spiral.\n\nIt seems the open letter broke that spiral. Adobe noticed the community still cared and had a real need for an open strategy around open source and a commitment to the long-term support of Magento Open Source.\n\nAs a result, the Open Source Task Force was created by the Magento Association, where the community and Adobe get together to voice these concerns, discuss the future of Magento and find common ground on important issues, to make sure the community can get back on their feet and close the gap between Adobe and the Community.\n\nDuring a one hour meeting every second week, several topics are being discussed, with mixed results. So far eight calls have taken place, usually joined by about 10 people, of which almost half are Adobe employees. The rest consists of community members (those that are able to join) under which three of our Mage-OS members; Bartek Igielski, Vinai Kopp and Willem Wigman.\n\nEven though there is little publicly visible output coming from these efforts, we believe it has been extremely valuable just to get an alignment on what the community needs from Adobe, and what Adobe is willing to provide.\n\n- Commitment has been made by Adobe to keep investing into Magento Open Source, and ensure us there is no plan for deprecation of the monolith\n- The community engineering team will get more resources in the near future\n- Adobe has proposed a Community maintained “Short Term Support” (STS) version of Magento Open Source. The plans are still at a very early stage, but they look quite promising. This is a clear signal that awareness of the Community and the importance of Magento Open Source is growing inside Adobe, and - if followed through - would demonstrate Adobe’s long term commitment to Open Source. There are many open questions which are being discussed in the task force.\n- Luma will be deprecated, but not on short term\n- Discussions are ongoing around the possibility of slimming down the core of the Magento Framework to allow multiple distributions in the future.\n- Adobe will not provide any marketing around Magento Open Source towards merchants from either magento.com, or the adobe.com website. The magento.com domain now redirects to a landing page at adobe.com with resources around Magento.\n\nIt is much clearer now what Adobe’s strategy is regarding Open Source, and that is a big win.\n\nWe now feel a lot more confident that Adobe will take care of the basic needs to be able to keep using Magento Open Source for the next couple of years. We can expect full vendor support for critical bugs, stability upgrades and security support.\n\nWhen Adobe follows through with their suggestion of a Community owned STS version of Magento Open Source, the power of the community and the backing of a large enterprise will enable innovation and growth of the Magento eco-system for many years into the future.\n\nThis is all of great value, and an investment from Adobe we should not oversee or underestimate. We are thankful for this support.\n\nIt is also now very clear that, even though Adobe takes care of the platform’s basic needs, it will not invest heavily in any innovation or feature development on it. The focus is very much on Adobe Commerce and it’s position in the Adobe ecosystem, building out integrations with other Adobe products and microservices, rather than building new features using Magento (PHP) extensions.\n\nIf we want the platform and community to flourish and grow, it will have to come from the community.\n\nSo now we know what we are planning for.\n\n### The Fork\n\nA fork was indeed created. Which is not a big thing in itself, since many developers fork Magento on a daily basis. It is even a requirement to be able to contribute to the platform.\n\nWhat is special about this fork, is that it is tracking changes on the official Magento repositories and automatically updates, then creates meta-packages from the repository and puts these into a distributed repository that can be used with Composer.\n\nFiguring out how to split out the mono-repo from Magento’s repositories and creating packages out of those, mirroring exactly the same output as Magento’s official repository took some time to reverse engineer. And to find the most performant and efficient way to get this done.\n\nWe will publish both the fork, the build scripts and all documentation on the process we went through publicly soon. Even though we’ve worked on this in the background, our goal is to be as transparent as possible about what we did and why.\n\nThese processes will be up for discussion as soon as we’ve published it and invited anyone interested into our Discord (see “The Community” below).\n\nThe Fork is just a contingency fallback for when the day comes when large deprecations might happen on the official Magento repository or when those would go away all at once. You might remember when Magento 1 was deprecated, not only the repository was gone, but also the merchant documentation.\n\nWe want to be prepared for any scenario in the future, and have complete ownership over a copy of the product and have the knowledge to maintain such an infrastructure.\n\nThis also includes the merchant documentation.\n\n### The Distribution\n\nThe interesting part will be the work on our own distribution. We imagine building a version of Magento that allows us a lot more flexibility to evolve.\n\nThis would include:\n\n- Removing optional functionalities in core, such as a choice between MySQL search or Elasticsearch, or removing MSI (Multi Stock Inventory) by default\n- Implement bug fixes faster\n- Implement performance improvements faster\n- Include new features\n- Repackage Luma into an LTS version, removing Luma from core by default\n\nAnd many other things we can’t even think of at this stage. It should allow us to do experiments again, and bring back innovation to the platform.\n\nSince the proposed Magento Open Source STS version is not yet realized, we believe we need to move forward with Mage-OS. Any work we do will be able to flow back into Magento STS when it exists and is in the hands of the community.\n\nThe community needs an initiative to keep the dialog with Adobe alive and growing.\n\n### The Community\n\nThe community needs a big shift. We’ve gotten caught up in negativity and got tired of the push back we got from those that got burned by the release of Magento 2.\n\nYes, we can safely state that the initial release of Magento 2 was premature and caused damage to many members of our community. Merchants, agencies and developers all alike.\n\nMany of those that were hurt during that period are no longer part of our community, based on their experiences from that moment in time, which is understandable.\n\nToday however, Magento 2 is in fantastic shape, thanks to a lot of effort put in by both Adobe and the community. The platform has never been more flexible and stable, filling all merchants’ needs.\n\nSo what our community needs is a new sound that resonates with today’s state. And leave the past behind us.\n\nWe have a vibrant community with businesses, people and families that are building their livelihoods on Magento offering Integrations, Extensions, Hosting, Payments, Marketing services and so much more.\n\nWe have everything we need, right in front of us. Positivity in our ecosystem will go a long way. New merchants are offered the choice for a platform every day, new students become professionals and new agencies grow out of those students every day.\n\nThe eCommerce industry keeps growing, and every platform keeps growing. The only thing we need to do is to get together and start moving.\n\nWe need Magento events to make a comeback, educate and welcome newcomers, celebrate our victories and help each other out, sharing solutions to our common problems as we’ve done for over a decade.\n\nMage-OS will open up to the public using Discord.com as a communication platform, where we would like to welcome you and exchange ideas on how to start defining the future of Magento.\n\nWe will publish the access information to this environment on our website and newsletter as soon as we’ve made it available.\n\n### The Magento Brand\n\nAdobe owns the rights to the Magento brand. They also decided not to market the Magento brand any longer. The Magento Association owns the rights to a subset of the Magento brand, for a limited amount of time. This means that we have very limited control over the brand.\n\nAnd that is okay. We will make our best effort to provide the branding around the product and make it clear it is the same product without violating intellectual property.\n\nMage-OS will be the name of our initiative, and the distribution we will build. Additionally, we’ve started working on a branding and content strategy.\n\nWe will make sure merchants have a place to go to and learn about the Magento platform and its capabilities.\n\n### The Mage-OS entity\n\nWe’ve also set up a working group to focus on an official entity for Mage-OS. This will include the organization structure, strategy, funding, partnerships and all that comes with that.\n\nThere are currently two weekly meetings: one technical meeting and one organizational. The form in which these meetings are being held is temporary until we’ve set up the basics and feel we have the capacity to expand more globally. When we open Discord up to everybody, we welcome new members to participate in these meetings, too.\n\nWe are very much aware of the closed nature of our current organizational structure, which is absolutely not meant for the long term. It merely exists in this form because we tried to stay small and regional to be able to move fast and plan meetings in the same time zone. We’re implementing a code of conduct and will focus on diverse representation in the organization as soon as possible.\n\n### Next steps\n\nWe’re planning to start bringing out regular updates on progress.

This should be fixed over the coming weekend.\n\nThe JavaScript based build tool is bundled as a docker image which will be used to create a Mage-OS mirror repository on any server with docker (or podman).  \nThis will allow us to change the underlying implementation of the tool creating the packages without impacting the mirror provider - they only need to pull the latest version of the image.\n\nWe agreed to host the initial mirror distribution on a server rented by us, because we don’t want to favor a specific hosting provider.  \nWe hope many hosting providers will use the opportunity to provide fast local package mirrors to their customers.\n\n### Opening up to the wider community\n\nWe want to open up our Discord and the mage-os GitHub organization once we have a fully functioning self built package mirror running. We are looking forward to collaborating with many developers from all over the world in building up the Mage-OS distributions. Before we open things up, we decided to publish a Code of Conduct on our website and ask everyone to agree with our shared base values before joining. We also need to set up team based access rights in the GitHub organization.\n\n## Organizational topics\n\n### Magento Association\n\nWe discussed our individual relationship with the Magento Association and agreed there is no conflict of interest if members of our group also fulfill tasks in the MA. We also agreed that by continuing to work independently of the MA as part of the Mage-OS community alliance, we also serve the community by helping move the status quo.\n\n### Magento STS vs LTS\n\nWe discussed how STS and LTS security updates might be handled, and who might be able to provide vendor based support.  \nSince Adobe wants to hand ownership of Magento STS to the community, they might not be able to provide security patches.  \nWe are convinced there is a shared interest in collaboration on this topic, and that a way to coordinate the release of security related patches can be found.  \nThis will be a topic for further discussion in the Magento Open Source Task Force.\n\n### Magento Open Source Content\n\nWe assembled a content plan for the promotional, informational and branding related content for merchants about Magento Open Source. Several members of the community have agreed to help create this content. As soon as we have at least ten meaningful articles we will publish them on the to be created mage-os.org website. Should Adobe or the Magento Association also decide to provide such content, we will be happy to move content there.\n\n### Magento and Adobe Commerce Support\n\nDuring the last Magento Open Source Task Force meeting we discussed the lack of publicly available long term support information for both Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source. Adobe members of the task force agreed that should be made available and stated they would look into it.\n\n### Docker Hub Username\n\nSadly “mageos” is not available.

It also is wonderful to see others selflessly provide shelter, money, material and time to help those who managed to flee, and to those who stayed to fight.\n\nHere are the updates relating to Mage-OS we made over the last couple of weeks.\n\n## Technical topics\n\n### Mage-OS Magento® Mirror Repository\n\nHypernode created the first Mage-OS mirror using the mirror-repo-generator image and [wrote about it](https://www.hypernode.com/blog/weve-created-the-worlds-first-mage-os-mirror/)! To our surprise they are already using their mirror to provision client instances, which means Mage-OS is already being used in the wild!\n\nOther hosting companies have also started to experiment with the mirror repo generator and plan on publishing their findings soon. Also, we have received some first PRs, which is wonderful.\n\nAs soon as 2.4.4 will be released next Tuesday it should be possible to make it available in mirrors, too, by running the mirror generator again.\n\nIf you have questions or ideas, please join our [discord](https://discord.gg/nvZDVA2NdC) and say hi in the #tech channel.\n\n### Mage-OS Distributions\n\nCreating a mirror repository is not our main objective. That’s only the first step towards creating our own distribution. Now that the mirror repository is fully functional, we move our focus to the first steps in creating our first custom distribution.\n\nThe first step for this is to figure out the automatic generation of the base package dependencies. First experiments have been done to get that information using static code analysis without the need for a full Magento installation.\n\nFiguring out this puzzle will allow the creation of nightly builds based on the current develop branch, which in turn will give us an opportunity to set up continuous integration.\n\n### GitHub permissions\n\nWe have now collected all the knowledge to implement Terraform to manage GitHub permissions for the Mage-OS organization repositories.

The purpose is...","## Open letter to the Magento Community\n\nDear Magento community,\n\nWith this open announcement we are letting you know that there will be a community organization driven fork of Magento. The purpose is to secure Magento’s long term viability for all the businesses depending on it.\n\nWhy do we believe this is the right step?\n\nThe Magento ecosystem is big. It’s been the dominant platform for eCommerce for a decade. It has driven innovation in eCommerce and empowered businesses of all sizes. Full of novel ideas born through a vibrant community, it is still unparalleled by any other eCommerce ecosystem out there.\n\nThe eCommerce landscape has changed over the years, now offering a wealth of SaaS, PaaS, and other off-premise solutions. Magento under Adobe has determined to do the same. The community is still there, but the enterprise product - now called Adobe Commerce - is moving towards composable microservices hosted in the cloud, only suitable for the largest merchants.\n\nThere has been talk about decomposition of the PHP Monolith by Adobe’s technical architects, meaning all parts of the PHP platform will be replaced by (Adobe) microservices. Ultimately, the entire Magento platform as we know it will be replaced.  \nFor reference, this was presented at [Adobe Summit 2021 in the talk “Extending Magento Commerce with Adobe I/O”](https://business.adobe.com/summit/2021/sessions/extending-magento-commerce-with-adobe-io-s604.html).\n\nThis makes for a lot of unknown variables. There is no public roadmap for Magento Open Source, and this has left a lot of the community (who believe the monolith is a very valid approach in many cases) feeling uneasy about the future of Magento.\n\nSo, we want to move forward. We believe we, the community, can maintain and evolve a fork in a way that will carry us into the future.\n\nWe intend for this to be a collaborative effort, ideally together with the Magento Association, and (through them) with Adobe. We have already reached out to the Magento Association to work with them, but it will take time to build a common understanding of how to move forward.\n\nThe fork will be upstream-compatible with Magento Open Source as long as it is supported by Adobe. That means, when the monolith is ultimately deprecated, all companies who want to remain on the monolith platform will be able to do so.\n\nWe want to earn the trust of the Magento ecosystem. We truly believe we can not only keep Magento alive, we can give it a bright future by putting the focus on merchants, big AND small.\n\nThis is only the beginning. Magento has a bright future ahead. We invite you to join us.\n\n_This initiative has been started by the companies and individuals signed below.

The purpose is to secure Magento’s long term viability for all the businesses depending on it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Why do we believe this is the right step?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Magento ecosystem is big. It’s been the dominant platform for eCommerce for a decade. It has driven innovation in eCommerce and empowered businesses of all sizes. Full of novel ideas born through a vibrant community, it is still unparalleled by any other eCommerce ecosystem out there.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The eCommerce landscape has changed over the years, now offering a wealth of SaaS, PaaS, and other off-premise solutions. Magento under Adobe has determined to do the same. The community is still there, but the enterprise product - now called Adobe Commerce - is moving towards composable microservices hosted in the cloud, only suitable for the largest merchants.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There has been talk about decomposition of the PHP Monolith by Adobe’s technical architects, meaning all parts of the PHP platform will be replaced by (Adobe) microservices. Ultimately, the entire Magento platform as we know it will be replaced.\u003Cbr>\nFor reference, this was presented at \u003Ca href=\"https://business.adobe.com/summit/2021/sessions/extending-magento-commerce-with-adobe-io-s604.html\">Adobe Summit 2021 in the talk “Extending Magento Commerce with Adobe I/O”\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This makes for a lot of unknown variables. There is no public roadmap for Magento Open Source, and this has left a lot of the community (who believe the monolith is a very valid approach in many cases) feeling uneasy about the future of Magento.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, we want to move forward. We believe we, the community, can maintain and evolve a fork in a way that will carry us into the future.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We intend for this to be a collaborative effort, ideally together with the Magento Association, and (through them) with Adobe. We have already reached out to the Magento Association to work with them, but it will take time to build a common understanding of how to move forward.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The fork will be upstream-compatible with Magento Open Source as long as it is supported by Adobe. That means, when the monolith is ultimately deprecated, all companies who want to remain on the monolith platform will be able to do so.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We want to earn the trust of the Magento ecosystem.

We nevertheless have managed to make progress with Mage-OS, too.\n\n## Technical topics\n\n### Mirror distribution\n\nThe mirror distribution available at [mirror.mage-os.org](https://mirror.mage-os.org/) is now fully functional. It can be used to install Magento Open Source versions 2.4.0 up to 2.4.3-p1 using independently built composer packages.\n\nTry it:\n\n```\nmkdir mage-os-243p1\ncomposer create-project --repository-url=https://mirror.mage-os.org/ magento/project-community-edition mage-os-243p1 2.4.3-p1\n```\n\nBuild your own mirror:\n\nIt is easy to host your very own mirror with self-built packages using the mirror repository generator found at [github.com/mage-os/generate-mirror-repo-js](https://github.com/mage-os/generate-mirror-repo-js).\n\nThe generation from scratch takes about 1.5 hours on a low-end server (2G RAM, no swap). We are actively improving the tool to make it faster and more usable, however, alternative implementations will be the primary tools in the future. The current JavaScript based implementation was started as a research project.\n\nIf you have questions of ideas, please join our discord at [discord.gg/nvZDVA2NdC](https://discord.gg/nvZDVA2NdC) and say hi in the #tech channel.\n\n### GitHub permissions\n\nNo progress has been made on this topic because of real life matters. Work will continue in the coming week.\n\n## Organizational topics\n\n### Operations management\n\nWe discussed two ways to bootstrap the organization behind Mage-OS:\n\n1. Find a person to act as the COO, who’s first task will be to create the organization and their own role. This would be a lot quicker, but it also would require someone who is able to work full time without immediately requiring compensation.\n2. Found the organization ourselves, which then allows us to collect funds. Then hire a COO.\n\nWe will take this second option as this allows us to make faster progress and deal with filling COO and other roles in near future. So far we have drafted by-laws which are being verified independently by two lawyers.\n\nWe are very excited about the prospect that soon there will be an organization to provide a solid foundation for Mage-OS!\n\n### Magento Association\n\nWe do not see the supporting organization around Mage-OS in conflict with the Magento Association.  \nEach is distinct. The Mage-OS organization moves quicker and brings a much-needed external point of view to the table, while the Association is able to work with Adobe through established channels and can rely on the support provided by a big company.\n\nMage-OS future-proofs Magento Open Source by providing an independent distribution. We envision Mage-OS, the Magento Association STS and Adobe LTS/Commerce distributions collaborating closely.\n\nShould at one time in the future Mage-OS become obsolete because of the Magento Association STS distribution, they can be merged.\n\nWe continue to believe speed is of an essence, so we will continue to move forward without being held back by established processes.\n\nThat’s all for today! Stay safe and prosper,\n\nThe Mage-OS folks","src/data/post/2022-03-18-week-10-and-11-of-2022.md","9ffcf7bf6f239153",{"html":276,"metadata":277},"\u003Cp>The ongoing horrific war in Ukraine means we continue to prioritize supporting our friends, family members and coworkers there.

Even though we do not consider it a likely scenario, if something were to happen to the `repo.magento.com` composer repository, this ensures Magento Open Source will always be available to the public.\n\nThanks to the QA tools created by [Damien Retzinger](https://github.com/damienwebdev) and [Daniel Sloof](https://github.com/danslo), which verify file parity and ability to install successfully, we are confident that our mirror packages are a drop-in replacement for the official Magento Open Source releases. At this time, the mirror includes all packages for Magento versions 2.3.7-p3 through 2.4.5.\n\nTo install Magento Open Source from the mirror, change `repo.magento.com` to `mirror.mage-os.org` in the `composer create-project` command or your `composer.json` file.  \nNo composer authentication is required. For example:\n\n```\ncomposer create-project --repository-url=https://mirror.mage-os.org \\\n    magento/project-community-edition install-dir\n```\n\nYou can also create your own mirror repository using the Mage-OS tooling. This might be useful for hosters who want to provide a mirror for their customers, or offer their own open-access mirror to the public. For more information, please refer to the [readme of the repo-generator](https://github.com/mage-os/generate-mirror-repo-js#usage) project on github.\n\nWe have a list of mirror composer repositories we are aware of at  \n[mage-os.org/distribution#magento-mirrors](https://mage-os.org/distribution#magento-mirrors).\n\nIf you have any questions or would like us to add your mirror, please join and ask in the #tech channel of our [Discord](http://chat.mage-os.org/).\n\n### ✅ The Mage-OS Magento® Nightly Upstream Repository\n\nIn addition to recreating previous upstream releases of Magento Open Source, we have also started to publish a nightly release based on the current development branches of Magento Open Source.\n\nFor the first time ever it is now possible to install a version close to the next upstream release with composer, matching the latest development code, without having to wait for an official beta release.\n\n```\ncomposer create-project --stability alpha \\\n    --repository-url=https://upstream-nightly.mage-os.org \\\n    magento/project-community-edition install-dir\n```\n\nKeep in mind that the nightly release might be broken sometimes, depending on the state of the code in the upstream Magento git repositories.\n\nWe hope this will be useful for vendors and extension providers to track compatibility of their products with upcoming releases.\n\nIt also was a great learning opportunity for us to figure out how to determine package dependencies and package versioning.\n\nThe nightly builds are available now. We will be publishing a status page to show if the current upstream version is broken or not, soon.  \nWe will also continue to tweak the versioning and generation process as we learn more.\n\nPlease join our [Discord](http://chat.mage-os-org/) if you have feedback or if you are interested in the release process.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nNow these two milestones are completed, we are focusing on the next steps towards a Mage-OS distribution that we can improve on while keeping compatibility intact. This will include:\n\n- Forking our mirror repositories\n- Automatically merging upstream changes\n- Exploring ways to handle merge conflicts as efficiently as possible\n- Running tests in a GitHub CI pipeline\n- Exploring ways to reduce the runtime for tests\n- Cleaning up the module dependency graph\n- Automating the permission setup on GitHub\n- Setting up a nightly build repository for the Mage-OS distribution\n- Choosing unmerged upstream PRs we want to introduce into Mage-OS\n- Figuring out how to make independent releases and consolidating them with upstream releases\n\nWe look forward to working through these topics and many more over the next weeks and months.  \nIf you are interested in helping, please join the Mage-OS [Discord](http://chat.mage-os.org/) and start chatting! We welcome any help!\n\n## Organizational topics\n\n### Mage-OS Association\n\nWe will probably be using [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/) as a platform to manage paid memberships for the Mage-OS Association. This is an important step to accomplish many of our goals for Mage-OS and the community as a whole. We expect the money raised through membership and donations to go to infrastructure and services, to hiring people to oversee and drive Mage-OS forward, and to directly funding development of the Mage-OS distribution through grants and other programs.\n\nThe membership levels are currently being discussed in the #membership channel on [Discord](http://chat.mage-os.org/). Please join and let us know your thoughts if this is of interest to you!\n\nAs always, stay safe, and keep an eye on our blog.

We strongly believe that a wide array of perspectives are a key factor in the success of any business, and can only bring richer insights and fairer decisions.\n\nToday we want to share our thoughts and address early feedback we received, in particular regarding the lack of geographical diversity in the governance of Mage-OS Association.\n\nToday, our board is made up of seven males and one female who serves as the Vice President with responsibilities to make decisions on behalf of the President.\n\nOur Business Control Committee has gender parity with one male and one female.\n\nThe ten individuals are spread between seven countries in Europe and North America. It is not yet the role model for diversity and inclusion that we are aiming for. We need your help to get there.\n\n### How did we get to this situation?\n\nWhen we decided to take an active role in the Magento Open Source ecosystem, the conversations happened to be between friends and business partners clustered in Europe.\n\nWe felt an urgent need to move fast, and in order to do that we kept the group small and agile.\n\nWe, the Mage-OS Association, do not believe we represent the whole ‘Magento Community’. We are just one part of it. But we also believe we can grow that part.\n\n### Where to now?\n\nThe strategy of keeping the steering group small enabled us to move fast and create results. However, now that we have a solid foundation, we want to grow to represent more of the Magento Community, while continuing our momentum.\n\nThe Mage-OS Association is founded, but still very young. We have technical processes and infrastructure, but they are far from complete. We have [Discord](http://chat.mage-os.org/) as a community hub, but it is still small.\n\nThese foundational key stones will enable us to grow and evolve, and include everyone in the Magento Community that agrees with our core values and our purpose.\n\n### Leadership & Board Membership\n\nSeveral times already we’ve heard that the Mage-OS Board should have representation from other geographic regions. And we agree, this would be ideal.\n\nHowever, it is not practical to have a board position only to represent.\n\nBeing on the board right now means doing whatever work is required for Mage-OS, without compensation, in addition to a regular job. This commitment enables Mage-OS to achieve its goals.\n\nAnybody who takes it on themselves to do that work will naturally become influential within Mage-OS as it continues to take form.\n\nEven without a position on the board, the direction of Mage-OS can be influenced significantly by engaged individuals who take responsibility and put in the hours.\n\n**Aside:** *Board members are elected by the general assembly, which consists of all Mage-OS Association members. Half of the board member positions will be up for election in two years, the other half in three. After this initial cycle the term of office for all board members is two years.*\n\n### Overcoming Privilege\n\nPutting in many hours into open source work for free is only possible when being in a privileged position. Creating a diverse and inclusive board with global representation, while also requiring work for free, is a dilemma. We believe it can be resolved over time through constant care and attention.\n\nIn the ideal scenario, the Mage-OS Association is able to pay members from less privileged situations to work on Mage-OS, and allow them to gain influence and take on official roles. This will allow real diversity, and has been part of the vision for Mage-OS from the beginning.\n\nRight now we don’t have funds to distribute for that purpose. Acquiring funds is the next step for the Mage-OS Association. Because one of the key values of Mage-OS is independence, the majority of funds will come through membership fees. (Join the discussion in [#membership](https://discord.com/channels/893449664093904936/1008574430563270697).)\n\nSoon we will be able to hire a Chief Operating Officer, who will work full time on running the association and grow it further. After that we can start funding members to work on Mage-OS. There is still a way to go, but by taking one step at a time, we will get there.\n\nWe are aware that Diversity is not just about geography and culture, and we are eager to also hear your thoughts and ideas on how we can be improved further in other areas such as Gender Equality.\n\nWe look forward to working with you on creating the future of Mage-OS!\n\n### Local Representation\n\nThe Magento family is a global network made up of business and friendship.\n\nThe Mage-OS Association Board can’t travel to all events. Constant travel is unsustainable for individuals and for the environment. Even so, we feel local and physical representation of Mage-OS within the Magento Community is super important.\n\nThis is why we need local Mage-OS representatives!\n\nRepresentatives would be people that attend Magento and eCommerce events in their region to give Mage-OS visibility, answer questions, and gather ideas and feedback from their local community (merchants, developers, agencies, and service providers). Then they share this information in the Mage-OS [Discord](http://chat.mage-os.org/) to raise awareness of their local situation.\n\nIf time allows and if interested, representatives could also organize Magento meetups or give presentations about Mage-OS at events.\n\nRepresentatives from different regions can support each other by sharing slides, processes, and experiences.\n\nWe invite you to become a Mage-OS representative for your local community!\n\n### What you can do today\n\nPlease help us:\n\n1. Develop the Mage-OS local representation and global community by letting us know you are interested in [Discord](http://chat.mage-os.org/)!\n2.

Here is an overview of what has been happening since the last blog post.\n\n## Technical topics\n\n### Mage-OS Magento® Mirror Distribution\n\nAdobe released Magento Open Source 2.3.7-p4, 2.4.3-p3, 2.4.4-p1 and 2.4.5 on the 9th of August! We are pleased to announce that these versions can now also be installed as independently built packages, using the [Mage-OS mirror](https://mirror.mage-os.org/).\n\nWhile preparing the releases, we discovered (very few) inconsistencies in upstream composer.json files that broke our build process. We reported these inconsistencies upstream to Adobe (for example in the [security package](https://github.com/magento/security-package/issues/321) and [adobe-stock-integration](https://github.com/magento/adobe-stock-integration/pull/1872) repositories), and they are being addressed. At the same time, we have improved the [build tool](https://github.com/mage-os/generate-mirror-repo-js) to account for these issues allowing Mage-OS to become more independent.\n\nFinally, Damien Retzinger from [Graycore](https://www.graycore.io/) contributed GitHub actions to automate testing builds in parallel. This allowed us to move much, much faster, and we are very grateful for his participation!\n\nDaniel Sloof created GitHub actions to check the integrity of the Mage-OS packages against the upstream releases. This QA tooling is invaluable.\n\nMany thanks to [Damien](https://github.com/damienwebdev) and [Daniel](https://github.com/danslo), and to all others like [Anton](https://github.com/speedupmate), [Daniel Fahlke](https://github.com/flyingmana) and many others who participated in discussions and helped with good ideas in the #tech channel or joined a stream on Discord.\n\n### Mage-OS Magento® Mirror Nightly Builds\n\nThe new versioning scheme for the nightly build packages, as discussed in the [previous post](https://mage-os.org/blog/mage-os-update-2022-week-30), has been implemented, and is currently being evaluated, if it indeed serves the desired purpose.  \nWe expect the nightly builds to be available soon.\n\n### Contributing\n\nPeople have been asking how to contribute. It is very encouraging to see that many people want to help, and so far we still don’t have a good answer.\n\nSince we are currently “meta-building”, instead of building Magento features and improvements, we are in a bit of a special situation. We expect this to change once the infrastructure for the mirror, nightly builds, and the Mage-OS distribution is closer to complete.\n\nThe usual approach to encouraging contributions to open source projects is to do “Issue grooming” and then to choose tickets that are good first issues. This approach is not applicable (yet) to the Mage-OS project.\n\nAt the moment, most people have started by joining [Discord](http://chat.mage-os.org/), following the #tech channel, and joining streams in the #Watercooler channels, where problems are being discussed and solved together.\n\nIt has been very valuable to interact in this way.\n\nCurrently, this is the best way to get started, as it helps develop an understanding of what is required at a given moment in time, be it debugging, writing code, pairing or coming up with ideas.\n\nSo if you are interested in helping, join a stream in Discord and get an idea what is happening. It is fun, too, if you like problem-solving and coding :)\n\nFor those who simply wish to keep up, start by following the discord #tech channel.\n\nWe are welcoming and inclusive at [chat.mage-os.org](http://chat.mage-os.org/)!\n\n## Organizational topics\n\n### Mage-OS Association\n\nVacation season is keeping us busy, but we are moving to complete the founding of the association.\n\nWe will form a committee to set the price for members and supporting members (companies).  \nIf you would like to be involved, please join the [Mage-OS Discord](http://chat.mage-os.org/) #membership channel and let us know!\n\nFor now that’s all, more updates are coming soon.\n\nThe Mage-OS folks","src/data/post/2022-08-15-mirror-2-4-5-release-and-many-contributions.md","37b8a066fede56a6",{"html":428,"metadata":429},"\u003Cp>Work has been progressing nicely, and we celebrate that more people are getting involved!

Content will continue to be updated.\n\n## Technical topics\n\n### Mage-OS Magento® Mirror Distribution\n\nQuite some work went into stabilizing older releases of the mirror distribution. All supported releases install cleanly and quickly now.\n\nAlso, we added release 2.3.7-p3 to the list of supported releases because it is still being used in some CI pipelines to test modules against it. Now all relevant versions can be installed from the [https://mirror.mage-os.org](https://mirror.mage-os.org/) composer repository.\n\nThank you to Daniel Sloof, Daniel Fahlke, and Damien Retzinger for helping to debug some of the issues! Your input was invaluable.\n\nPlease join our [Discord](http://chat.mage-os.org/), say hi in the #tech channel, and join the conversation!\n\n### Mage-OS Magento® Mirror Nightly Builds\n\nSo far we haven’t really made the nightly release repository public, and for good reason. Until now every package in a nightly release was given a new version built from the git branch prefix and the current date (YYYYMMDD) as a alpha package number, for example `2.4-a20220721`.\n\nThis worked and resulted in an installable release, however, it breaks most composer version constraints of packages built for Magento. The primary use case for nightly builds is testing, and this is very cumbersome with this naming scheme.\n\nSo we decided to change this, and instead use the last release version of a package, followed by a fourth part .1 version, followed by the date. For example, the last release for the `magento/framework` package is `103.0.4`. The nightly builds of this package will in future have the version `103.0.4.1-a20220721`. This satisfies commonly used composer version constraints like `^103.0.4`, and any package under test can simply be installed without any hassle.\n\nThanks to Anton, Willem, Simon, Daniel F., and Daniel S. (and others whom we might have forgotten) for providing input on this topic. So far most of the implementation has been done by our own Vinai, but we’re very open to helping hands. If you’re interested in joining the effort, please don’t hesitate to reach out!\n\nOnce this change is implemented we will post details on how to install a build nightly release, and also how to build nightly releases yourself.\n\n## Organizational topics\n\n### Magento Open Source Content\n\nThe content team continues to work on creating content for a Magento Open Source focused website. More content creators are very welcome! Every Monday at 4pm CET we meet to coordinate. Please join our [Discord](http://chat.mage-os.org/) and visit the #content channel to participate.\n\n### Community\n\nThe [Mage-OS Discord](http://chat.mage-os.org/) is becoming more lively, which is lovely. Please join and introduce yourself, it is great to see people are interested in an independent Magento Open Source.\n\nAlso, we want to have online meetups or town hall hangouts, soon. These will be a great place to get to know each other, ask questions, and hear about what is happening.\n\nFinally, we are using Discord’s audio and video channels to stream longer dev sessions about once a week. This usually is rather spontaneous, usually during the weekend. Keep an eye out for Vinai or others hanging out in the Watercooler chats, if you are interested to discuss technicalities, pair program, or just watch.\n\nThat’s all for today!

In recent months we’ve:\n\n- Replicated Magento release packages with an independent build process from the source repositories;\n- Published a public Magento mirror composer repository using that independent process;\n- Released the first Magento updates since establishing the mirror (2.4.5 and related patches);\n- Had our first third-party mirror published by the same process;\n- Added validation and integrity checks to the mirror builds (thanks to Damien, Daniel, Anton, and others);\n- Created a nightly repository of Magento development builds, automatically generated each day from the latest Magento repositories;\n- Finalized the Mage-OS Code of Conduct and Association Statutes;\n- And more\n\nWe have much more planned for the future! Our next technical focus will be on establishing the Mage-OS Distribution itself, to allow direct community contributions and releases of Mage-OS.\n\nYou can already start using our Magento mirror repository or nightly repository today!

In this update we want to share what we’ve been up to, why, what we’re planning next, and finally, how you can get involved!\n\n## Why does Mage-OS care about Magento content?\n\nSince acquiring Magento, Adobe has stopped publishing the magento.com domain, and now forwards that to information about their paid Adobe Commerce product, with no mention of Magento Open Source at all. In the process, they removed valuable information about Magento Open Source and made it difficult to learn about the platform or start using it. Our aim is to create a replacement site where merchants, developers, and other professionals can find out key information about the platform in one central location.\n\nFurthermore, with the inaccurate ‘Magento is Now Adobe Commerce’ marketing still being used by Adobe, we feel it’s more important than ever that information about Magento Open Source is made publicly available.\n\n## What is Mage-OS’ vision for a Magento content site?\n\nIn addition to creating a replacement for content from the old magento.com site, we want to make it a proper community portal. We want this content site to be a gateway and repository to everything you could want to know about Magento as a platform, product, and community. The website should allow you to discover the entire ecosystem.\n\nThese are the areas we want this site to contain:\n\n- A strong landing page that explains what Magento Open Source is and helps direct visitors to the right place to learn more based on their needs (e.g. merchants, developers, etc.)\n\n- Multiple product pages with technical (but merchant friendly) details about the different features Magento Open Source offers, e.g. multistore, CMS/Page Builder, catalog and search, checkout, SEO, marketing, etc.\n\n- Platform comparison pages, e.g. how Magento Open Source compares against other eCommerce platforms, including an unbiased comparison with Adobe Commerce (the paid version of Magento that Adobe offers)\n\n- Multiple links for developers, merchants (such as documentation sites) and community resources (such as the various forums and chat groups)\n\n- A community directory where agencies, technology providers, and merchants can list their businesses, sites, and services\n\n- News and event listings\n\n- A blog with merchant case studies and industry best practice articles\n\nNote: we’re also open to further suggestions!\n\n## Our Journey So Far\n\nThere’s obviously a lot we want to achieve. So far we’ve focused on getting a development site set up that we can add content to, and have made progress in the following areas:\n\n- The main landing page\n\n- An initial draft of the site navigation, including many external resources\n\n- A number of product/functional pages\n\n- The community directory\n\nWe certainly won’t launch with all the above listed areas, and we will be taking an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) approach to ensure we can launch something useful, given the harm caused to the ecosystem by not having an informative magento.com site.\n\n### On Adobe, the Magento Association, the Magento branding, and the magento.com domain\n\nOur initial intention was to create a non-Mage-OS-specific site that could replace magento.com, ideally on the same domain or a similar one such as magento.org, and utilize the Magento branding (e.g., the Magento logo) on that informational site. Additionally, we offered to hand over control of that site to the Magento Association (MA) or even Adobe, should they wish to maintain it.\n\nMany discussions were held during the Magento Association Task Force and Content Committee meetings over the past year, with Adobe representatives present on multiple occasions. However, after almost a year of attempting to make this happen, and due to the lack of movement, interest, and willingness (from Adobe, not the MA), we’ve unfortunately accepted this will probably never happen. As a result, we are putting the site fully under the Mage-OS brand rather than Magento (though references to Magento Open Source as a product will still remain).\n\n## Next Steps\n\nUp until the past few weeks, we’ve only had a handful of people involved, focused on getting a site up and running and adding content. However, recently we’ve had additional help offered that should improve and accelerate our progression going forward.\n\nFirst, maxcluster (a Germany-based hosting company) have kindly offered their support. They are currently undertaking a strategic review of what we’ve done to date and how we can better move forward in terms of architecture, content, audience, and messaging. We hope to have the results of this in the coming weeks.\n\nSecond, we’ve had assistance offered by Amasty to help organize and manage the content effort better! They’ve set up a Trello board and planned all the current tasks we have to work through, so we can better see progress and meet deadlines.\n\nAfter the strategic review, we’ll further update the tasks and deadlines and have a much clearer roadmap to launch.\n\n## How Can You Get Involved?\n\nIf you want to help us create this Mage-OS/Magento ecosystem content site, there are many ways you can be involved, listed below. But first off, you’ll need to join the [Mage-OS’ Discord server](http://chat.mage-os.org/) (as this is used as our main communication method) and be in agreement with our [contribution guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vUYJ7gPut-uefaSmOA8SzgoYh9fYBaFmSzKq9XTfujc/edit#).\n\nHere’s how you can contribute:\n\n- Join the conversation and discussion on the #content channel on our Discord server\n\n- Share your views and input on our weekly meetings\n  - These take place on Mondays at 15:00 UTC (07:00 PST, 10:00 EST, 15:00 GMT, 16:00 CET, 17:00 EET, 20:30 IST) on our Discord server\n\n- Help write or review content for pages on the site\n\n- Create/provide assets we can utilize on the site (e.g. screenshots, imagery, diagrams, and videos)\n\n- Contribute to the overall site structure and content required\n\n- Help with organizing and planning content and other tasks\n\n- Aid with the overall strategy and vision of the site\n\n- Undertake frontend development (theming) to help improve the look and feel of the site\n\n- Add your organization, site, or service offering to the community directory section of the site\n\nAlternatively, if you just want to keep up to date with the ongoing progress, then please ensure you are subscribed to the [Mage-OS newsletter](https://mage-os.org/newsletter).\n\n## Thanks\n\nFinally, we wouldn’t have gotten this far without the help of many folks in the community. So, a big thank you to Arron Moss, Barbaros Selim Büyükelçi, Benno Lippert, Bernard Robbins, Brent Peterson, Damien Retzinger, Dominik Rammert, Nicole Mentzen, Sergej Derzap, Willem Wigman and many others (plus, of course, all the [Mage-OS Board](https://mage-os.org/organization/about) members who’ve been involved).\n\nOnce again, we’ll have more to share soon.

As a result, we are putting the site fully under the Mage-OS brand rather than Magento (though references to Magento Open Source as a product will still remain).\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"next-steps\">Next Steps\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Up until the past few weeks, we’ve only had a handful of people involved, focused on getting a site up and running and adding content. However, recently we’ve had additional help offered that should improve and accelerate our progression going forward.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>First, maxcluster (a Germany-based hosting company) have kindly offered their support. They are currently undertaking a strategic review of what we’ve done to date and how we can better move forward in terms of architecture, content, audience, and messaging. We hope to have the results of this in the coming weeks.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Second, we’ve had assistance offered by Amasty to help organize and manage the content effort better! They’ve set up a Trello board and planned all the current tasks we have to work through, so we can better see progress and meet deadlines.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>After the strategic review, we’ll further update the tasks and deadlines and have a much clearer roadmap to launch.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"how-can-you-get-involved\">How Can You Get Involved?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>If you want to help us create this Mage-OS/Magento ecosystem content site, there are many ways you can be involved, listed below.

Because it felt so good to catch up in person at Meet Magento New York 2022, we wanted to do it again. Also, this event is strongly connected with Mage-OS as Ignacio Riesco is CEO of the organizing agency Interactiv4, and also sits on the board of Mage-OS.\n\n## Mage-OS at Meet Commerce\n\n### Mage-OS Presentation\n\nVinai Kopp, Board President and founding member of Mage-OS, will be presenting at Meet Commerce Spain: [“Mage-OS: Fork it, Own it, Grow it, Better”](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6996423767186923520).\n\nThis talk is inspired by all the conversations we’ve had with you, people and friends from the Magento Community, who have been expressing support, giving constructive feedback, and asking questions ([lots of questions](https://mage-os.org/frequently-asked-questions)).\n\nThe talk will cover Mage-OS’s vision and goals, purpose, plans and progress. You won’t want to miss it!\n\nFun fact: Even the presentation title came up from Discord casual conversation with our community!\n\n### Mage-OS Booth\n\nAs a Silver Sponsor, we’ll have a nice booth at the conference. Come find us to chat Mage-OS, hang out, and get your Mage-OS button badge!\n\nHere is a list of Mage-OS board members and contributors who are confirmed at this stage.

This conference is open to all eCommerce Platforms, not just Magento and Adobe Commerce, but also:\n\n- Shopware\n\n- Salesforce\n\n- BigCommerce\n\n- Shopify\n\nFor merchants (who can attend for free), it’s a unique opportunity to get multiple perspectives on ecommerce. They will be able to compare Open Source and SaaS, different offerings and technologies, and see what platform works better for their life stages, size, organizational structure, industry verticals, and markets.\n\nUnlike massive multi-platform shows such as NRF, IRCE, eCommerce Berlin, or Paris Retail Week, this event will have a friendly feel with hundreds of participants, not thousands, and you will get quality time to catch up with old friends. We expect people from the Magento community to attend from all over Europe and the world, and we look forward to seeing you there.\n\nThe weather should be nice and sunny, which might be a good change if you live in other parts of the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nWe can’t wait to see you.

We hope you found as much energy as we did to help reach your 2023 goals.\n\nWhile it was quiet on the outside, we still got a lot done, thanks to your contributions.\n\n## Founding the Mage-OS Association\n\nIn full transparency, we are still waiting for the Mage-OS Association foundation to be finalized. Our first application and appeal were returned by the court of Warsaw for statutory changes. We’ve been working with our lawyers and the court to resolve the situation. The latest word is the court and our lawyers are treating our case as a top priority, and we hope to have good news soon.\n\nThis delay has prevented us from opening a bank account or conducting any business that requires a registered entity. Until then, we aren’t able to open our membership program, or collect or disburse funds to speed up the pace of our activities.\n\nThe silver lining is that this has given us more time to prepare the membership program, budget, and plans for the coming year. Here’s a sneak preview of the Mage-OS supporter program badges:\n\n![A preview of the Mage-OS Association's upcoming membership badges, courtesy of Amasty](https://mage-os.org/blog/2023/2023-01-27-mageos-badge-preview.png)\n\nA massive thank you to Sergej Derzap and the Amasty graphic team for their work designing these badges!\n\n## Technical Update\n\nWe have discovered that the nightly-mirror builds are an excellent way to be aware of what is happening inside Magento Open Source.\n\nRecently, an issue in the Magento Open Source repository caused the Mage-OS nightly builds to fail. Adobe implemented a workaround in the 2.4.6 beta builds (outside of the Magento repository), which we have also applied to the nightly builds until a proper and permanent solution is applied.\n\nIn brief: A new [Magento_Elasticsearch8](https://github.com/mage-os/mirror-magento2/tree/2.4-develop/app/code/Magento/Elasticsearch8) module is added to Magento Open Source 2.4.6, and requires `elasticsearch/elasticsearch` library version 8. That directly conflicts with the existing `Magento_Elasticsearch7` module, which requires version 7 of the same library. Only one can be installed at a time, so this causes an unresolvable dependency failure and a broken build.\n\nIn 2.4.6-beta1, Adobe resolved this by removing the requirement from `Magento_Elasticsearch8`. However, that makes the `Elasticsearch8` module non-functional, because composer will always install `elasticsearch/elasticsearch` version 7. Damien Retzinger opened [an issue](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/36687) on the Magento Open Source repository to track and discuss this problem.\n\nThese kinds of issues can go undetected for a long time between releases, and this is another reason we are happy to have the nightly builds in place as an early warning system.\n\nDuring the holiday season most of us involved in the technical development of Mage-OS took a break, though some continued to power on (shout out to Adam Crossland!). Since the new year, momentum has picked up again. Work is progressing on the continuous integration pipeline, which is critical to us accepting contributions to the Mage-OS Distribution.\n\nThere is also discussion ongoing about the first new feature we will add to the upcoming Mage-OS Distribution.\n\nWe invite you to join our technical meetings every week on Tuesdays at 3 PM CET (9 AM EST) at [chat.mage-os.org](http://chat.mage-os.org/)!\n\n## Content Update\n\nThings have been moving along nicely on the new Mage-OS website. The new website will give vital information about Mage-OS and Magento Open Source to merchants and professionals, since such content no longer has a home at Magento.com.\n\nSince the last update, the content team has migrated all content from the existing Mage-OS site, decided on all the additional content we need for launch, added many content pages, and updated the navigation menu following a strategic review.\n\nWe’re now working on the final content and design for our initial content site launch. We are hopeful to meet (if not exceed) our target of launching the new site by April.\n\nThis has all been achieved thanks to our team of regular contributors. Special thanks to Sergej Derzap (and the Amasty team), Roland Haselager, Indraneil Khedekar, Aaron Moss, and John Prendergast for their recent contributions. We would not have gotten this far without them.\n\nIf you want to get involved, please reach out in the #content room or join our weekly meetings on Mondays at 4 PM CET (10 AM EST) at [chat.mage-os.org](http://chat.mage-os.org/). Right now we’re looking for help with:\n\n- Technical content writing about Magento Open Source as a platform/product, and platform comparisons\n\n- Non-technical content writing about the Magento community\n\n- Collating and populating useful resources for merchants, developers, and other Magento professionals\n\n- Creating/adding images, screenshots, and videos to pages to make them visually more appealing\n\n- Some small frontend development tasks to tidy up the theme and improve performance\n\n- 301 Redirects from the old site\n\nIf there is something else you feel you can contribute with, please let us know!\n\n## Community Update\n\nAs of today, over 600 of you have joined our [Discord community](http://chat.mage-os.org/), and nearly 900 are following us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mage-os/).\n\nA number of localized channels have been created in Discord for the following communities: Netherlands, Ukraine, Poland, France, India, and Italy. If you have a local ecommerce community you’re interested in giving a home in Mage-OS, let us know!\n\nThe Dutch community has gone a step further, by founding a new Dutch Magento community organization under the name of Mage-OS: [Mage-OS Nederland](https://nl.mage-os.org/). This organization was formally created in December 2022. During the general meeting of Mage-OS Netherlands on January 19th 2023, its new board was installed and consists of Jisse Reitsma, Sanne Bolkestein, Sander de Graaf, Jeroen Boersma, Roland Haselager, Core de Reeper, and Michiel Gerritsen. We hope that the success of Mage-OS NL can serve as a blueprint for other regional groups going forward.\n\n## Mage-OS in the World\n\nCommunity events and outreach have stepped up in a big way recently, and we thank you all for your interest!\n\nWe were delighted to meet many of you at recent events, and thank you for all the great chats and feedback you’ve given us.

Adobe implemented a workaround in the 2.4.6 beta builds (outside of the Magento repository), which we have also applied to the nightly builds until a proper and permanent solution is applied.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In brief: A new \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/mage-os/mirror-magento2/tree/2.4-develop/app/code/Magento/Elasticsearch8\">Magento_Elasticsearch8\u003C/a> module is added to Magento Open Source 2.4.6, and requires \u003Ccode>elasticsearch/elasticsearch\u003C/code> library version 8. That directly conflicts with the existing \u003Ccode>Magento_Elasticsearch7\u003C/code> module, which requires version 7 of the same library. Only one can be installed at a time, so this causes an unresolvable dependency failure and a broken build.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In 2.4.6-beta1, Adobe resolved this by removing the requirement from \u003Ccode>Magento_Elasticsearch8\u003C/code>. However, that makes the \u003Ccode>Elasticsearch8\u003C/code> module non-functional, because composer will always install \u003Ccode>elasticsearch/elasticsearch\u003C/code> version 7. Damien Retzinger opened \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/36687\">an issue\u003C/a> on the Magento Open Source repository to track and discuss this problem.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>These kinds of issues can go undetected for a long time between releases, and this is another reason we are happy to have the nightly builds in place as an early warning system.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>During the holiday season most of us involved in the technical development of Mage-OS took a break, though some continued to power on (shout out to Adam Crossland!). Since the new year, momentum has picked up again. Work is progressing on the continuous integration pipeline, which is critical to us accepting contributions to the Mage-OS Distribution.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There is also discussion ongoing about the first new feature we will add to the upcoming Mage-OS Distribution.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We invite you to join our technical meetings every week on Tuesdays at 3 PM CET (9 AM EST) at \u003Ca href=\"http://chat.mage-os.org/\">chat.mage-os.org\u003C/a>!\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"content-update\">Content Update\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Things have been moving along nicely on the new Mage-OS website.

True...","Case Studies","Hollywood love stories usually start with some ups and downs in a relationship and then a big showdown – preferably with a great sunset as a backdrop. True love stories are often much simpler: You find the perfect match and stay together. In the case of Magento 2 and [Online Spy Shop](https://www.onlinespyshop.co.uk/), a UK-based company offering surveillance equipment for companies, governments and individuals, one can certainly speak of true love.\n\n![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/OnlineSpyShop.png)\n\n## How it began\n\nAlready in 2018, Steve Roberts, proprietor of OSS Technology Ltd - Online Spy Shop, decided for Magento 2 to take his existing online store to the next level. Steve explains: “We were looking for four elements in a new platform: We wanted it future-proof, we wanted security, ease-of-use and a platform that allowed us to grow.” Although Magento 2 was still in its infancy at that time, Steve and his team believed in the strength and solidity of it and its possibilities for exceptional growth. Steve: “It was a great choice we made, and we are still happy with this choice”.\n\n## Top 5 functionalities to fall in love\n\nBack in 2018 – and still valid today – Online Spy Shop’s USP was very simple: transparency.\n\n“For us, transparency means that we provide a good service and offer good products AND treat all clients the same regardless of status – which implies that we always uphold integrity”, Steve explains the company values.\n\nTo back this, the online store has, from the beginning, certain functions considered mandatory:\n\n1. Customer reviews: These show real examples of customer satisfaction to generate trust. (Do you want to implement such a powerful feature? [Read more here](https://mage-os.org/why-magento/features/marketing-seo/).)\n\n2. Site search: Helps the customer to find his product as quickly as possible without any distraction – if not wanted.\n\n3. Content: Shows that the company has expert knowledge and is, therefore, trustworthy.\n\n4. Live Chat: To offer superior customer service by answering in real time.\n\n5. Address Validation verification service: Suggests validated addresses for fast and correct delivery.\n\nThey also set a focus on a streamlined and user-friendly yet comprehensive checkout. Including the acceptance of all payments that they needed and being compatible with PCA Predict, they met their expectations to provide their customers with the possibility of placing an order with minimum friction. \n\n## Make an effort to grow the love\n\nSurveillance equipment is used by most people these days, whether that be a non-technical individuals using home CCTV to businesses, large corporations, private sectors, public sectors and law enforcement. In short, surveillance equipment can be used as a positive aid to gather important video / audio evidence in sometimes difficult and sensitive situations.\n\nIt is, therefore, not surprising that a provider of such equipment should also make sure that the user experience in the store is as positive as possible. Having this in mind, Online Spy Shop implemented plenty of improvements and optimizations over time to ensure a great customer experience.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KsI1zdISpJsLHCBs2otsUHcD-I3ZhmhMLhe0yHgoU0kIM6bWOcCok6EHUgXk-llDG26Bevga3jl8zYYLeQuvIOw6hMztg9_6dgcWAsq75mBRFn49lhK7ROPSaBhwlNZm5E_HCTtfmDQkWDgGXTnpa9U)\n\nThe first thing customer will notice (and fall in love with) is the significantly improved top navigation bar. Not only did Online Spy Shop include a variety of trust elements such as the delivery time, positive reviews and an easily accessible phone support, but also a focus on “Made in UK”-products and UK-based support.\n\nAnd to help find the customer’s love interest more easily, Online Spy Shop highlights its bestseller products and offers a mega menu, including a ton of important information. Once you decided on a product, you’ll find more specifications on the according product page. But if you want to win over the customer, you’ll need to offer more – and that’s what Online Spy Shop is doing: On the dedicated product page, not only find the exact delivery date and the possibility of social sharing (and who doesn’t want to share one’s new love with the world) together with express payment options. \n\nThe check-out page – provided by [OneStepCheckout](https://www.onestepcheckout.com/) for Magento 2 – lifts the purchasing process and, therefore, the user experience to another level. \n\n## The love for performance\n\nIn 2021, Online Spy Shop wanted to boost the website’s findability and increase the browsing experience even more. They did this by launching a new version of the website using [Hyvä](https://www.hyva.io/) - a frontend theme for Magento. Steve explains the reason: “The whole point of using Hyvä Themes is the improvement of the Core Web Vitals, which leads to more visibility by ranking higher in Search Engine Result Pages (SERP). And actually, it allows a better, safer and faster browsing experience for any visitor landing on our website.”\n\nOnline Spy Shop didn’t stop just there but put extra effort in to become as trustworthy as they need to be for customers of such a business. Steve: “We did that by cramming as much information as we could in that rectangle above the fold. Why? Consumers’ attention span is reducing to just a few seconds, and we wanted to make sure that they’ll get all the important and useful information as quickly as possible.”\n\nTo differentiate from the competition, they provided additional transparency by highlighting customer reviews, dispatch time and delivery fees, which is reiterated on the product pages too. By showing the width and breadth of their product assortment – not only showing the range in a mega menu but also highlighting and providing quick links to best-selling products – they also stand out from the competition.\n\n## Check-out with your love-interest\n\nOnce the customer has found the perfect piece, Online Spy Shop offers an easy-to-use checkout.\n\nFor those who don’t want any strings attached, even without a registration or a required login. Email, address and phone number validation is self-evident, but the check-out also offers additional features such as address lookup and autofill.\n\n“We implemented OneStepCheckout in the beginning and are still more than happy with that decision”, says Steve. “What we can clearly see in the various iterations of the checkout design is that the business made sure customers are focused on completing checkout and not tempted to click away from this page.” The iterations include the removal of navigation bars and various icons, but also the replacement of Sage Pay with Stripe so that the customers can stay on the same page to pay.  \n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/jkYizenG4xbgyRLZnvRlj8IQaym22GP_UNIbrPSDuOT5xmMErktgx8rcslkEgHH8qY1zByC-y4tnDgIoqP22oOC_SkDKYo7ACsT_h0XJRrTyvW8BjmEZXIMObBLjwqJV5tU9pZC8-i01hZuMnVIi-2o)\n\nAlthough these efforts are certainly made to maximize the checkout conversion, it adds to the flawless user experience on the site.

Online Spy Shop has found its perfect match with Magento and was – and is – able to meet customer requirements through ongoing improvements and optimizations. \n\nHe also found a great agency - [Foundation Commerce](https://foundationcommerce.co.uk/) \\- to support him in his next growth phase using new innovative technologies like Hyvä. As Steve Robert puts it:\n\n *“Ryan’s credentials and skillset are a rare find and bringing Foundation Commerce agency onboard was the best decision we’ve made\\_\\_.”* \n\nPerfect match with technology and people leads to the customer’s trust, which is the base of a longtime relationship and the “happily ever after”.\n\nFor those who need a bit of support finding the way to the customers’ heart, please, check out the [various features Magento offers](/?page_id=557) you.","src/data/post/2023-03-12-happily-ever-after-online-spy-shop-and-magento-2.md","4292c1c0449100fd",{"html":679,"metadata":680},"\u003Cp>Hollywood love stories usually start with some ups and downs in a relationship and then a big showdown – preferably with a great sunset as a backdrop.

Achieving [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) for customers on a **budget** is no easy task. In this article we discuss the pain points and share some of our processes in achieving regular zero-downtime deployments for merchants using Magento Open Source or Adobe Commerce.\n\n## Why is it so difficult with Magento 2?\n\nA standard deployment on Magento 2 usually involves certain commands/processes being ran in the event of certain changes. Here we explain the key deployment types.\n\n- **bin/Magento setup:static-content: deploy** - If you have frontend changes which involved typically Javascript or CSS, then you will need to run this. This can be achieved in \\*zero-downtime.\n\n- **bin/Magento setup: upgrade** - If you have upgrades to Magento or modules or are installing a new module, these require setup:upgrade to be ran and during this phase, the site should be in maintenance mode.\n\n- **Custom code changes or patches** - Either of these in most cases can be achieved with \\*zero-downtime \n\n\\* Zero-downtime deployments can only be achieved if you have some way of executing the deployment commands away from the production site. If you do not have a non-production server or managed deployment pipeline such as MGT Code Deploy, MDOQ or Magento Commerce Cloud, then usually you have to put your website into maintenance mode whilst this runs. You want to avoid this. Without a solid deployment process, the TCO will be significantly more. \n\n### **How does this benefit the merchant?**\n\nAs an agency this is the question we always ask.\n\nIn summary, most of the work we carry out typically falls into one of the above 3 types. In 2 of these cases, with the correct deployment pipeline (building all your static content away from production), you can achieve these with zero-downtime, therefore, delivering fast, iterative changes (CI/CD). Due to costs, CI/CD is not typically common practice with smaller merchants however, with automation it is more cost-effective. So the up-shot is, if you have a deployment process where you can deploy your static content away from production, then for all your front-end development work, you could deploy many times a day. This is really where the Magento product outshines other platforms, since very few platforms allow such control over code and development processes. \n\n**Dare we comment on Adobe Commerce Cloud?**\n\nIn a word yes. It’s fair to say this product has yet to yield real success of it’s own making. Since launch it has flown on the coat-tails of the Magento reputation and been hampered with many issues. Key issues remain. There is no facilitation of development instances or the use of RDE technology, which means however quick a non-production instance can be rolled up on Commerce Cloud, the developer is still ultimately responsible for themselves before they can become a productive ‘coder’. Secondly, the short-sightedness and complete lack of consideration for the Open Source product around dev ops standardisation, continues to yield project/platform failures and ultimately remains a weakness in the future of Magento Open Source for SME’s. Good agencies work very hard in developing their operational processes to best manage this risk, but ultimately, different agencies have their own intellectual property and this makes it more difficult for merchants to feel in control and potentially work with multiple agencies. This needs to evolve! Since it is clear that Adobe have no interest in Open Source, then now is the time they should relinquish the platform to an independent organisation.\n\n### **How to achieve zero-downtime deployments**\n\nI'm almost certainly going to miss options here however this content is here to be revised and updated accordingly. \n\n1. Magento Commerce Cloud: Reading their documentation, it does not actually sound like true zero-downtime is achieved, however if there are no database changes or module upgrades then we assume that deployments could take place with minimal front-end customer impact. Ie the site does always go into maintenance mode however the amount of time could be very small. I've noted this here more for perspective, but since this article is focussed on supporting concepts with Magento Open Source, it's an irrelevant option.\n\n2. MGT Code Deploy: Looks powerful, but since it’s only for AWS and carries a monthly fee of 99 Euros, it might not suit the smaller merchants. That said I would recommend any small business on Magento consider something like this to improve stability and therefore frequency of your deployment process. If you only deploy once every 6 months you should be asking yourself the question, did I pick the right platform?\n\n3. MDOQ offers intelligent deployments and is compatible with AWS and any other production hosting, however with integrated production hosting, MDOQ slashes development costs even when deployment multiple times per day. \n\n4.

One distinguishing factor which governs our appreciation for peer agencies, is whether they help merchants manage their own extensions. There are few things worse than taking on a project when their licensing and extensions are masked with confusion over who purchased what. This not only makes it more difficult to work with composer but it also adds legal risk of ownership and adds time and cost to future upgrades.\n\nIf as a merchant, you own all the accounts and therefore the contact methods, licenses, accounts and composer keys, then you are in control and can become agnostic and even work with multiple development agencies or teams simultaneously. \n\n## Monogency (mono agency)\n\nYes it’s a made up word! - or Mono Agency. We refer to agencies with a culture aimed not at providing the best service, but protecting their own commercial interests i.e tying the merchant in as much as possible.\n\nSome agencies insist on being the single SI to a Magento merchant, often citing SLA's as their reasons. This might be the only way they are prepared to work. That’s not to say this is not still normal, however as merchants are now developing more mature dev ops processes, we are seeing merchants choose to work with multiple agencies or development teams at a time. This year alone we have experience of working with 2 very large UK retailers who have both internal development teams and also are working with multiple SI’s at the same time. This requires standardization in operational processes and ultimately ownership of said processes by the merchant. \n\n## The future is Polygency (poly agency)\n\nAgain not a word! \n\nFor us, merchants whom can be agency-agnostic means they can refrain from agency tie-ins, which is ultimately risk-reducing if done properly. In 15 years of Magento development, the costs we have charged to take over projects and help merchants become more independent, has often outweighed the development costs. This should not be part of the modern TCO (total cost of ownership), otherwise the platform and the merchant both suffer.\n\nIf you are working with an agency or developer who insists on purchasing your extensions and not helping you manage your own vendor accounts, it's likely you will become more constrained to their processes, culture, costs, skill-sets. Ultimately this is a risk to your business. \n\nTips when looking to purchase Magento extensions:\n\n- Never leave it to an external supplier, partner or contract developer\n\n- Always purchase and manage your extension subscriptions in-house\n\n- Keep a record of your extension vendors/accounts/keys\n\n- Always try and ensure all contributing parties use Composer when managing vendor extensions","src/data/post/2023-02-25-calling-all-merchants-purchase-your-own-extensions.md","74cabb054cd4aefc",{"html":743,"metadata":744},"\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Simple ways to streamline operations and reduce costs\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In almost 15 years of working with Magento we have taken on many projects from other agencies large and small.

Many vendors develop extensions to offer such functionalities. Therefore, it is not in Mage-OS's interest to think about developing functionalities the ecosystem can provide with a wide range of options.\n\nWe still need to make plans for **education** and **certifications**. It is an interesting topic and certainly in line with our mission of ensuring **longevity and prosperity** for the Magento platform. So be prepared to read some news on this topic in the future.\n\nThe request regarding our position on the **front-end** arises when Magento's front-end technology is at a standstill. On the one hand, the integrated theme (Luma) is still officially the default technology, the only frontend that is functionally complete and supported by all third-party vendors. On the other hand, it has long seemed that the decoupled theme based on **PWA Studio** (Venia) should replace the integrated theme; since, after some time, it still doesn't achieve the required functional completeness, it gives the impression of an abandoned project (but I'm happy to be proven wrong).\n\nIn between, free and commercial new technologies have emerged that are winning over developers, making it unclear what the de facto standard is in the Magento world. Stimulated by this request, we are working to provide a **complete picture** to merchants and agencies to facilitate their choice. Check out our website regularly for content updates on the topic.\n\nFinally, regarding the type of support Mage-OS will offer, we plan to create a company owned by the association solely responsible for providing **technical support**. The company will not compete with the ecosystem but rather **fill the gap** between merchants and agencies: it will ensure full support for the core platform. To achieve this project, we will need funds, so the first step will be to launch the **membership program**, the goal of the current quarter.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\n![Meetup refreshments, provided by Extera](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/1680778468539-edited.jpeg)\n\n\u003Cfigcaption>\n\nSandwiches\n\n\u003C/figcaption>\n\n\u003C/figure>\n\nI want to thank PUG Romagna and Extera for the opportunity (and the buffet) and all those who participated.

Over 150 passionate...","Mage Titans returned to Manchester, UK, on April 22nd 2023, for the first time in nearly 4 and half years, and what a comeback it was!\n\nOver 150 passionate community members attended the event, and while the main focus of any Mage Titans event is aimed at developers, there were also many others from different backgrounds involved. The day itself was an incredible success, with many great speakers, including long-time community members and newcomers to the stage, giving talks on a wide range of topics, from in-depth technical talks to productivity, mental health and well-being.\n\n![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MageTitans-1.png)\n\nThere was a strong turnout from Mage-OS, including our President, Vinai, Vice President, Thien-Lan, Board Members Alessandro, Peter-Jaap and myself (John), plus many of our incredible contributors from both our technical and content committees, as well as board members from our first local community initiative group: Mage-OS Nederland.\n\nMage-OS was a hot topic all weekend, starting out on Friday night at the Dev Exchange pre-event meetup, through to talks during the main event and even late into the after-party!\n\n## Dev Exchange debate\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\n![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Dev-Exchange-MT23-1024x576.jpg)\n\n\u003Cfigcaption>\n\nMage Titans Dev Exchange\n\n\u003C/figcaption>\n\n\u003C/figure>\n\nOn the Friday evening before the event, around 30 community members gathered together for a small event to catch up and discuss topics suggested by the attendees. Given this was the return of Mage Titans after such a long time, the majority of the event ended up being people catching up with old acquaintances over a beer, but one topic hit a nerve and provided engaging discussion for over an hour. You guessed it… Mage-OS!\n\nThe chat ranged from [what Mage-OS has achieved so far](/?page_id=336), why certain things have taken longer than planned (in some people’s opinion), what Mage-OS should focus on next, what developers and agencies want and need from Mage-OS, and what would help Mage-OS move faster (spoiler alert: more contributors and funds!).\n\nWhile the debate and opinions did get a little heated at times, everyone involved was on board with the overall mission that Mage-OS has set out to achieve - to ensure a successful future for the Magento platform. Furthermore, it highlighted the passion that remains in the Magento ecosystem, along with the desire to nurture and grow this community we all love.\n\n## The main event\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\n![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Dome-MT23-1024x469.jpg)\n\n\u003Cfigcaption>\n\nRob and Gareth from Space 48 kick off proceedings in the dome\n\n\u003C/figcaption>\n\n\u003C/figure>\n\nThe main day itself took place on a surprisingly sunny Manchester day, and in a new location, after the closure of the much loved Comedy Store. The new venue didn’t disappoint, however, the ‘dome’ being a stunning setting for a day of talks.\n\n## Building Mage-OS\n\nAfter a handful of engaging talks in the morning, it was time for our President, Vinai, to take the stage. Vinai’s clearly no stranger to the stage at Magento events and has talked about Mage-OS on multiple occasions, but this was the first time anyone had given a technical talk on the platform.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\n![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Vinai-on-Stage-MT23-1024x576.jpg)\n\n\u003Cfigcaption>\n\nMage-OS President Vinai presenting on stage\n\n\u003C/figcaption>\n\n\u003C/figure>\n\nVinai’s talk outlined the process, complexity and challenges of our journey towards building our own distribution. It highlighted the many parts of the Magento release and package management that people often take for granted and the fact that Magento’s (Adobe’s) own process is not actually open source.\n\nTaking the main Magento 2 mono-repo and splitting it up into the many packages that are eventually installed when creating a new project via composer was the main challenge, but Vinai also explained the many other quirks uncovered along the way. This included how Adobe’s own released packages contain many inconsistencies (which we had to replicate), how bundled extensions are not built from publicly accessible repos and the different types of additional packages that needed handling (such as the inventory and page builder repos).\n\nThe talk was definitely an eye-opener for many folks, especially those not so close to the technical side of the project. While it certainly outlined the complexity of the challenge and the time it needed for us to reach a point where we could offer our mirror and nightly builds, it also highlighted that when passionate and talented folks get together, we can achieve great things!\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBchGPck\\_d4\n\n\u003Cfigcaption>\n\nVinai Kopp - Mage-Os: The Journey\n\n\u003C/figcaption>\n\n\u003C/figure>\n\n## The Future of Magento\n\nAfter further stimulating talks in the morning and a lunch break, we returned for the afternoon session, which kicked off with a panel discussing the ‘small’ matter of the future of Magento.\n\nThe panel was hosted by longtime Magento community advocate Rebecca Brocton and included the inventor of Hyvä, Willem Wigman, Space 48 and Mage Titans founder, Jon Woodall, recently appointed Executive Director of the Magento Association, Mathias Schreiber, and last but not least, our very own Thien-Lan Weber, Vice President of Mage-OS.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\n![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Future-of-Magento-Panel-MT23-1024x576.jpg)\n\n\u003Cfigcaption>\n\nThe Future of Magento Panel\n\n\u003C/figcaption>\n\n\u003C/figure>\n\nThe panel were presented with a variety of questions that were proposed by community members and event attendees before and during the panel, which included questions around the future of the frontend of the default frontend of Magento (Luma), what the community needs most from Adobe (to listen/transparency), what’s happening with the Magento Association, and of course, the future plans for Mage-OS!\n\nAs a quick aside, our plans at Mage-OS remain consistent for the time being: continue building out our tooling so we can get to a point where we can offer [our own standalone distribution](/?page_id=326) and accept code contributions from the community and begin innovating on new features, improve the content on Magento Open Source and Mage-OS on this site, and finalise the founding of our association so we can open up membership and begin to take funds to accelerate the above further, along with trying to recruit more contributors to help our cause!\n\nThe most poignant takeaway from the panel, however, came when the topic of current community engagement was raised (via a [poll about whether people felt more, less or the same amount of engagement with the community than in the past, or are newcomers to the ecosystem](https://app.sli.do/event/9b9UFa5mJPGMzh2qtgUsmN/live/polls)). This led the discussion to move on to how we get new generations to join the ecosystem and become excited and engaged with the platform, which prompted Willem to issue a rallying cry to existing community members, especially those in prominent positions, to stop posting negative content (even if partly in jest) and focus on promoting a positive image that accurately portrays the joy and passion we all have for the community and platform.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f7t10F39cI\n\n\u003Cfigcaption>\n\nThe Future of Magento Panel\n\n\u003C/figcaption>\n\n\u003C/figure>\n\n## More talks, more chat, good times!\n\nThere were further talks through the afternoon, and Mage Titans legend Tadhg Bowe rounded off the day with his trademark comedy/self-care/productivity routine! Following this, it was time for the after party, where the chat and buzz remained late on into the evening, including some questionable photos!\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\n![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Mage-OS-Friends-MT23-768x1024.jpg)\n\n\u003Cfigcaption>\n\nMage-OS & Friends at the photo booth!\n\n\u003C/figcaption>\n\n\u003C/figure>\n\n## Recap and Takeaways\n\nThe entire event was an overwhelming success and felt like a real reunion for the Magento developer community, but equally, it was great to plenty of new faces enter the ecosystem. We’ve come away re-energized, enthused and it reaffirms our belief that pushing forward with Mage-OS will play a important role in re-invigorating the community and helping the Magento ecosystem to grow and innovate.\n\nOur key takeaways from the event are:\n\n- The Magento community is still as passionate and driven as it ever has been - we just need more events like these and working groups/initiatives to push things forward\n\n- Like Rome, Mage-OS wasn’t built in a day, and it’s important we take stock of what we’ve achieved so far from unpaid community contributions alone to get to a point where we can begin to start building out our own distribution and start taking on members (and funds) to expedite our growth\n\n- If we want to encourage newcomers into the space, positivity is key; we need to ensure we portray the Magento community and ecosystem externally as the welcoming and encouraging space that it is\n\n- We need to continue promoting our openness and desire for collaboration; we recruited a few new folks to our weekly tech and content meetings off the back of the event, and we hope to continue to grow these committees moving forward\n\nOn that note, if you’d like to get more involved, whether by simply joining the discussion on our Discord Server or by joining one of our committees, please visit our [Get Involved page](/?page_id=331). And, if you want to feel the passion of the community first-hand, then check out our [events page](https://mage-os.org/community/events/) for what is upcoming next.\n\nFinally, we’d like to express our thanks to Gareth, Rob, Molly, Jon and the rest of the Space 48 team for bringing back Mage Titans and putting on an incredible event.

Vinai’s clearly no stranger to the stage at Magento events and has talked about Mage-OS on multiple occasions, but this was the first time anyone had given a technical talk on the platform.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cfigure>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Vinai-on-Stage-MT23-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cfigcaption>\n\u003Cp>Mage-OS President Vinai presenting on stage\u003C/p>\n\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\u003Cp>Vinai’s talk outlined the process, complexity and challenges of our journey towards building our own distribution. It highlighted the many parts of the Magento release and package management that people often take for granted and the fact that Magento’s (Adobe’s) own process is not actually open source.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Taking the main Magento 2 mono-repo and splitting it up into the many packages that are eventually installed when creating a new project via composer was the main challenge, but Vinai also explained the many other quirks uncovered along the way. This included how Adobe’s own released packages contain many inconsistencies (which we had to replicate), how bundled extensions are not built from publicly accessible repos and the different types of additional packages that needed handling (such as the inventory and page builder repos).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The talk was definitely an eye-opener for many folks, especially those not so close to the technical side of the project. While it certainly outlined the complexity of the challenge and the time it needed for us to reach a point where we could offer our mirror and nightly builds, it also highlighted that when passionate and talented folks get together, we can achieve great things!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cfigure>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBchGPck%5C_d4\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBchGPck\\_d4\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cfigcaption>\n\u003Cp>Vinai Kopp - Mage-Os: The Journey\u003C/p>\n\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"the-future-of-magento\">The Future of Magento\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>After further stimulating talks in the morning and a lunch break, we returned for the afternoon session, which kicked off with a panel discussing the ‘small’ matter of the future of Magento.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The panel was hosted by longtime Magento community advocate Rebecca Brocton and included the inventor of Hyvä, Willem Wigman, Space 48 and Mage Titans founder, Jon Woodall, recently appointed Executive Director of the Magento Association, Mathias Schreiber, and last but not least, our very own Thien-Lan Weber, Vice President of Mage-OS.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cfigure>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Future-of-Magento-Panel-MT23-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cfigcaption>\n\u003Cp>The Future of Magento Panel\u003C/p>\n\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\u003Cp>The panel were presented with a variety of questions that were proposed by community members and event attendees before and during the panel, which included questions around the future of the frontend of the default frontend of Magento (Luma), what the community needs most from Adobe (to listen/transparency), what’s happening with the Magento Association, and of course, the future plans for Mage-OS!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As a quick aside, our plans at Mage-OS remain consistent for the time being: continue building out our tooling so we can get to a point where we can offer \u003Ca href=\"/?page_id=326\">our own standalone distribution\u003C/a> and accept code contributions from the community and begin innovating on new features, improve the content on Magento Open Source and Mage-OS on this site, and finalise the founding of our association so we can open up membership and begin to take funds to accelerate the above further, along with trying to recruit more contributors to help our cause!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The most poignant takeaway from the panel, however, came when the topic of current community engagement was raised (via a \u003Ca href=\"https://app.sli.do/event/9b9UFa5mJPGMzh2qtgUsmN/live/polls\">poll about whether people felt more, less or the same amount of engagement with the community than in the past, or are newcomers to the ecosystem\u003C/a>). This led the discussion to move on to how we get new generations to join the ecosystem and become excited and engaged with the platform, which prompted Willem to issue a rallying cry to existing community members, especially those in prominent positions, to stop posting negative content (even if partly in jest) and focus on promoting a positive image that accurately portrays the joy and passion we all have for the community and platform.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cfigure>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f7t10F39cI\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f7t10F39cI\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cfigcaption>\n\u003Cp>The Future of Magento Panel\u003C/p>\n\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"more-talks-more-chat-good-times\">More talks, more chat, good times!\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>There were further talks through the afternoon, and Mage Titans legend Tadhg Bowe rounded off the day with his trademark comedy/self-care/productivity routine!

This has mainly been around setting up a global not-for-profit organization and all the paperwork required to make sure we do things right, such as accepting funds for legal and legitimate activities along with the appropriate accounting and tax considerations.\n\nThis has included the need for our President, Vinai, to travel in person to Poland (where our association has been legally founded) to set up and finalize bank details with fellow board member Maciej, who has been instrumental in forming the association.\n\nFollowing this visit, we can now proudly announce that we have a bank account, and as soon as we have an accounting firm and some minor details finalized (which will hopefully only take a few more weeks), we can open membership and sponsorships to help finance our next growth stage.\n\nIf you want to be notified when our membership scheme opens, [sign up to our newsletter](/?page_id=597)!\n\n[Sign Up](/?page_id=597)\n\n## Tech / Product\n\n### Mage-OS Distribution\n\nThings are progressing well, and we’re keeping this update brief, so focus can be kept on finalising our own Distribution. We’ve now been able to build a working Mage-OS install (where packages are installed under the `mage-os`, not `magento` composer vendor namespace). The final steps are to perform some code cleanup and finalise the CI (Continuous Integration) process. Keep an eye out for more updates soon!\n\n[About the Mage-OS Distribution](/?page_id=326)\n\n### 2.4.6-p1 update\n\nIn case you missed it, Magento Open Source 2.4.6-p1 was released last month, and that’s available on our mirror as well: [mirror.mage-os.org](https://mirror.mage-os.org)\n\n### Sonassi Mirror\n\nWe are delighted to announce support from Sonassi, a leading hosting company in the UK. Here is the link to their dedicated Mage-OS mirror: [mirror.sonassi.com](https://mirror.sonassi.com/)\n\n## Content\n\n### Mage-OS Website\n\nSince the new Mage-OS website launch earlier this year, the content team has been diligently working to continue enhancing the site. This includes richer content, and much improved design.\n\nIn particular, we are very proud of our new [Get Involved page](/?page_id=331) and [Magento Developers Resource page](/?page_id=89). \n\nA big shout out to everyone on the Content Committee for spending their spare time volunteering to help make these impactful improvements. In particular we’d like to thank Sergej Derzap and his team at [Amasty](https://amasty.com/) for the consistently excellent design output, and Indraneil Khedekar at [Content Scribers](https://www.contentscribers.com/) for bringing those designs to reality.\n\n### Developer Documentation\n\nOne of our next areas of focus is developer documentation. While there has always been substantial documentation for developers since the launch of Magento 2, the docs have become less friendly with the recent move to Adobe’s Experience League. In addition, the devdocs have never provided a great or welcoming introductory section for newcomers and junior developers.\n\nWork has already started on our own simplified and user-friendly version of the docs, initially focused on introductory content. A huge shout-out to David Lambauer from [run_as_root](https://run-as-root.sh/) for his time spent kicking this off. You can see the early results here: [https://devdocs.mage-os.org](https://devdocs.mage-os.org/docs).\n\nWant to join the fun and contribute?

However, we’re planning ahead to make sure we get the best content from one of the biggest Magento specific events in Europe to share with the wider community on our blog.\n\nIf you’re attending the event in London on Tuesday 18th July, and would like to share your feedback on any of the talks or your overall experiences from the day, please get in touch with us so we can include it in our article (with full credit of course!)\n\nA big thanks to John Prendergast from [Aonach](https://aonach.com/), one of our regular committee members, for putting together [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xmo1Ld55w4cUYTPwP8tu96wEiQStpvUL1LdrOsQily8/edit#gid=0) that details the full agenda of the day so we can plan out who would like to cover which topics. Also thanks to Brent Peterson and his team at [Content Basis](https://www.contentbasis.io/) who have offered to help pull the final article(s) together once we have all the contributions.\n\n[Get Involved](/?page_id=331)\n\n### And That’s Not All…\n\nWe’re also working on multiple other areas, such as finalizing membership content for when that opens (which will include business directory listings); looking into an unbiased overview of all the storefront options available for Mage-OS / Magento Open Source; better guidelines and submission process for those that would like to contribute blog articles or case studies; and exploring improvements to our events page.\n\nIf any of the above sounds like something you’d be interested to help with, then please join us on our weekly content meetings on Mondays at 4 pm CEST / 10am EDT.\n\n[Get Involved](/?page_id=331)\n\nIn addition, we’re always after more merchant case studies and insights/best practice articles for the site if you have something you’d like to contribute!\n\n[Contact Us](/?page_id=717)\n\n## Events\n\nJuly is filled with hot events, especially in Europe, where you’ll be able to catch up with many Mage-OS board members, supporters and contributors. We’ll be bringing our much sought-after Mage-OS stickers to these events too, so don’t miss out!\n\n### MageUnconference Netherlands\n\nUtrecht, 12-14th July\n\nThis is an unconference: Be prepared for plenty of fun and sharing. There is no program, there are no official speakers, there is just a group of developers chatting about all kinds of topics. Thank you to Jisse Reistma from Yireo and [Mage-OS Nederland](https://nl.mage-os.org/) for putting this together!\n\n[MageUnconference NL](https://mageunconference.nl/)\n\n### Meet Magento UK\n\nLondon, 18th July\n\nOne of the largest Magento focused conferences in Europe is back for another year of great talks and a chance to meet up with so many folks from across the Magento ecosystem.

It's similar to a regular conference, which means experts and specialists attend the event, presenting and listening to various talks, networking and gaining experience.

September 2023, the checksum of several of the composer packages on [mirror.mage-os.org](https://mirror.mage-os.org/) will change. This will likely lead to warnings during subsequent composer operations on projects utilizing the mirror.\n\nThere is no reason for alarm - there is a technical reason for the update.\n\nWe recently discovered a flaw in the integrity check used to confirm that Mage-OS mirror packages are identical to Magento Open Source packages. We have fixed the flaw, and have ensured all Mage-OS mirror packages are identical to their Magento Open Source counterparts.\n\nWe do not expect to have to change the checksums of released packages again.\n\nIf you are interested in details, please read on.\n\n## Why are the checksums changing?\n\nEver since we started publishing self-built packages on [mirror.mage-os.org](https://mirror.mage-os.org/) we have been using GitHub actions to ensure our packages are a drop-in replacement for the packages from repo.magento.com.\n\n### [](https://gist.github.com/Vinai/71de90b17b3f44fb7fa25169114c2a87#the-old-package-integrity-check-process)The old package integrity check process\n\nAfter the packages for a given Magento Open Source Mirror release were generated, that release was installed twice:  \nonce using the Mage-OS composer repository, and once using the Magento composer repository.\n\n```\nComposer create-project --repository-url=\"https://mirror.mage-os.org\" magento/project-community-edition:$VERSION ./mageos\ncomposer create-project --repository-url=\"https://repo.magento.com\" magento/project-community-edition:$VERSION ./magento\n```\n\nThen the check compared the versions of all installed packages using `composer show`.\n\n```\ndiff \u003C(composer show -d ./magento | sort) \u003C(composer show -d ./mageos | sort)\n```\n\nIf there were no differences, the same package versions were used in both installations, meaning the requirements of all `composer.json` files were resolved to the same package versions.\n\nFinally, the check compared all files, excluding composer and caching files.\n\n```\ndiff -rq -x \"*composer*\" -x \"*autoload*\" -x \"*mage---*\" ./magento ./mageos\n```\n\nIf any differences were found, the mirror release failed. If all versions and files were the same, the check succeeded.\n\n### [](https://gist.github.com/Vinai/71de90b17b3f44fb7fa25169114c2a87#the-problem)The problem\n\nThe old integrity check only checked the installed versions were identical at the point in time the two installations were made.\n\nIt turned out that in some `composer.json` files of Magento Open Source, wildcard constraints were used, while Mage-OS used exact version constraints.\n\nFor example, version 1.3.0 of the package `magento/module-adobe-stock-image` requires (among others) the package `magento/module-adobe-stock-client-api`.\n\nMagento Open Source uses the version constraint `2.1.*`, while Mage-OS used to use `2.1.0`.\n\nNow, when Adobe releases a new package that matches such a wildcard constraint, the new version would be installed on Magento Open Source installations, but not on Mage-OS installations.  \nConsequently, the integrity check for a release that previously passed would no longer succeed, because the Mage-OS installation would not change.\n\nRegardless of which approach to package version constraints is \"better\", since the goal of the Mage-OS mirror is to provide drop-in replacement packages, the Mage-OS packages had to be updated to also use the same wildcard constraints as Magento Open Source.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/mage-os/generate-mirror-repo-js/issues/75), where Damien Retzinger describes the problem in depth.\n\n### [](https://gist.github.com/Vinai/71de90b17b3f44fb7fa25169114c2a87#the-new-package-integrity-check-process)The new package integrity check process\n\nTo fix the problem, the integrity check now no longer compares only the version of installed packages, but instead compares the `require`, `require-dev`, and `suggests` sections of all Mage-OS packages with their corresponding Magento Open Source counterpart directly.\n\nThis allowed us to identify all packages that might have caused installations to diverge over time.\n\nThe [new integrity check](https://github.com/mage-os/generate-mirror-repo-js/blob/develop/.github/workflows/integrity-check.yml) was written by Vladyslav Podorozhnyi during the Mage-OS Hackathon in Würzburg a few days ago.

However, due to poor implementation they were facing multiple technical and performance related challenges. \n\nTo accelerate the big rig hauling their entire business forward and help them smoothly deal with any traffic, the company turned to [Amasty](https://amasty.com/)'s “repair shop” with a request to realize Magento's full potential.\n\n## Drop-Off\n\nAfter contacting Amasty, who developed over **80%** of the extensions used on the cooling components store, Titan Rig explained that the maintenance of their Magento-powered website was being outsourced. However, the results of their cooperation so far had been underwhelming. \n\nMany store pages took from **12** to whopping **25 seconds** to load and search results appeared in no less than **16 seconds**. Waiting times got even longer in the evenings, when the traffic was at its peak. Worse than that, the website would regularly crash and stay down for around 10 minutes – on a lucky day, that is.  \n\nNo doubt, all of this had a very negative effect on organic traffic, customer satisfaction, conversions, and online sales. But Titan Rig was not looking to move e-commerce systems. They appreciated Magento’s flexible, omnichannel, and open-source nature and simply wanted to have their store optimized.  \n\n## Inspections & Diagnosis\n\nA performance audit of Titan Rig’s store unveiled a clear imbalance in server resources; they were overpowered for the slow morning traffic yet too weak to handle peak times in the evenings.\n\nTesting also helped to detect a number of code errors and Magento best practices violations, which caused loading speed decline. Some of the key issues were:\n\n- **ObjectManager** direct call in template files\n\n- **ObjectManager** in module logic\n\n- Too much logic in **PHTML** templates\n\n- **Block objects** created in template files\n\n- Plugins with **around()** instead of **before()** and **after()**\n\n- **cacheable=“false”** in layout handles\n\n## Repair Works\n\nTo balance out server resources, Amasty’s “mechanics” decided to enable **auto-scaling.** Thanks to Magento’s flexible hosting, the team easily activated additional server nodes and further customized hosting services to match the website’s traffic patterns. All these efforts helped to ensure that the website would smoothly tackle even peak loads.\n\nFixing all the uncovered coding issues and implementing Magento best practices was all it took to significantly increase the website speed. With pages loading in just **2-4 seconds** and Time to First Byte (TTFB) equalling **150-180 milliseconds**, Titan Rig’s store officially entered the green _‘Good’_ speed zone. \n\n## Engine Tuning\n\nThe results were already excellent but Amasty knew that Magento could go even faster. The team offered to replace the existing MySQL-powered search engine with [**Algolia**](https://amasty.com/algolia-search-for-magento-2.html) –a lightning-fast search technology that fit both the Magento environment and Titan Rig’s business needs like a glove. Implementing Algolia on the store helped to achieve more relevant search results that fully loaded in under **2-3 seconds** instead of the crazy 16.  \n\n## Test Drive\n\nWith the page load speed raised from 15-25 seconds to 2-4 and Algolia search showing results in just 2-3 seconds, Titan Rig’s desktop Magento store got a definite **‘Passed’** in Core Web Vitals Assessment by Google’s PageSpeed Insights.\n\n![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-1-1024x768.png)\n\nKevin Keating, Vice President of Marketing and Sales at Titan Rig, provided more details on the results of the collaboration:\n\n_“We’ve seen a significant improvement in our overall traffic, and the website has been better equipped to handle it. We’ve had better visibility in Google because we don’t have any more errors on our page. We have A+ ratings on other testing websites, and even our customers have seen a noticeable improvement in the website’s performance.”_\n\n## Customization\n\nConvinced of Magento’s potential and Amasty’s competence, Titan Rig decided to re-launch one of the projects they had unsuccessfully attempted with the freelancers: the implementation of **a real-time PC cable configurator**. The solution was aimed at helping customers personalize their cables on the website by choosing different plugs and combining as many as 40 different cable colors.\n\nBecause of Magento’s extensive capabilities for customization and integration, the Amasty team successfully developed the product configurator and integrated it with Titan Rig’s entire e-commerce system. Now, whenever a client creates a unique cable right on the website, the order specifications are automatically transferred via **Linnworks and APIs** to the warehouse. There, the magic of creating one-of-a-kind cables happens.\n\n## Back on The Road Again\n\nRefined and upgraded, Titan Rig’s store hit the road – now faster, more stable, and ready to handle any traffic. The enhanced Magento performance helped the company to boost customer satisfaction, conversions, and sales. The cable configurator, a brand-new website feature, successfully attracts new clients and makes the company stand out among competitors. \n\nPleased with the revitalized Magento store, Titan Rig now entrust Amasty with the full ongoing maintenance of their website.\n\n_“It’s the professionalism that’s most impressive. They’re honest. I’ve never worked with a company that’s so responsive, even when dealing with other third-party software applications. They don’t just let things sit around.

Huge thanks to David Lambauer and the Run As Root team for putting that on, and for everyone that participated!\n\nWe are in the final stages of preparing for a release of our very own Mage-OS Distribution! Recently that includes:\n\n- Changes to the [package generation process](/?p=2570);\n\n- Finalizing a GitHub Action for baseline coding standards testing of pull requests;\n\n- Preparing a release process, including changing package names and versions in a way that’s intercompatible with Magento;\n\n- Admin branding changes;\n\n- GitHub Actions maintenance;\n\n- And more\n\nWe are looking forward to sharing big news here soon!\n\n### Dev Docs\n\n[Mage-OS developer documentation](https://devdocs.mage-os.org/) is coming together well!\n\nHere is where we need more help:\n\n- Provide Feedback: Let us know your thoughts on the existing documentation. Are there areas that could be clearer? Is there information that’s missing or could be expanded upon?\n\n- Suggest Topics: Are there specific topics or areas in Magento 2 development that you feel need more detailed documentation? Share your suggestions, and we’ll work on incorporating them!\n\n- Contribute Content: If you have expertise in a particular area of Magento 2 and are willing to share your knowledge, we’d love for you to contribute content to the DevDocs.\n\n- Report Issues: If you come across any inaccuracies, ambiguities, or bugs in the documentation, please report them so we can address them promptly.\n\n- Spread the Word: Help us reach more Magento 2 developers by sharing Mage-OS DevDocs within your networks and on social media. The more contributors we have, the richer and more comprehensive our documentation will be!\n\n[Join Discord](http://chat.mage-os.org/)\n\nJoin our tech calls on Tuesdays 9 a.m. EST/ 3 p.m. CET\n\n## Memberships\n\nWe’ve lined all but one duck in the row. In the last months we’ve arranged our bank account, accounting company, settled legal matters, and set up a Stripe account so that we can now accept membership contributions on our [Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/mage-os).\n\nWe have not shouted about it yet because we would like a lower-fee option before collecting large amounts.

This release is based on Magento 2.4.6-p3, plus additional contributions including a refreshed...",[18],"We are proud to announce version 1 of the Mage-OS Distribution!\n\nThis release is based on Magento 2.4.6-p3, plus additional contributions including a refreshed admin panel. We will continue making enhancements over time, as they're contributed by the open source community.\n\nBecause they're based on the same code, all of your existing Magento extensions will work with Mage-OS too!\n\nUPDATE 2023-10-11: With the release of Magento security patch 2.4.6-p3 today, we've also published Mage-OS Distribution 1.0.1.\n\n## Installing Mage-OS\n\nYou can create a new Mage-OS project with the following SSH command:\n\n```\ncomposer create-project --repository-url=https://repo.mage-os.org/ mage-os/project-community-edition .\n```\n\nAfter a successful composer download, you will need to run the installer. Please see [DevDocs: Installation Guide for Mage-OS](https://devdocs.mage-os.org/docs/main)\n\n## Moving to Mage-OS\n\nIf you are already using Magento 2.4 and PHP 8.1+, you can change to Mage-OS by running the following in SSH:\n\n```\ncomposer config repositories.0 composer https://repo.mage-os.org/ && \\\n    composer require mage-os/product-community-edition --no-update && \\\n    composer remove magento/product-community-edition magento/composer-dependency-version-audit-plugin magento/composer-root-update-plugin --no-update && \\\n    composer remove sebastian/comparator --dev --no-update && \\\n    composer update --no-plugins --with-all-dependencies\n```\n\nWe strongly recommend updating to the latest Magento version (currently 2.4.6-p3) before changing to Mage-OS, to minimize issues.\n\nYour specific situation may require additional changes to your `composer.json` file. Generally this will involve changing `magento/` package names to `mage-os/`, or updating dependency versions.\n\n## Release Notes\n\nThis release is based on Magento 2.4.6-p3, plus community contributions merged since. It also includes the following Mage-OS-specific changes:\n\n- Removed adobe-commerce/adobe-ims-metapackage, magento/adobe-stock-integration, magento/google-shopping-ads, paypal/module-braintree, temando/module-shipping (thanks to Vinai Kopp)\n\n- Admin theme Mage-OS re-brand (thanks to Ryan Hoerr)\n\n- Mage-OS brand logo and name changes (thanks to Kiel Pykett)\n\n- Fixed Maestro Domestic CC detection pattern to prevent false positives (thanks to Ryan Hoerr)\n\n- Increased the default max admin session size to 1 MB (thanks to Ryan Hoerr, and Maciej Tomaszewski and others involved on the upstream discussions)\n\n- Faster category product count (thanks to Damien Retzinger, and Vincent Enjalbert who created the original upstream PR)\n\nHuge thank you to everyone that has contributed to the Mage-OS infrastructure, tests, actions, and more to get us here, including:\n\n- Vinai Kopp\n\n- Damien Retzinger\n\n- Daniel Sloof\n\n- Adam Crossland\n\n- Tjitse Efdé\n\n- Gowri Sankar\n\n- Vitaliy Golomozy\n\n- David Lambauer\n\n- Simon Sprankel\n\n- Kamlesh Luhana\n\n- Kiel Pykett\n\n- Christian Münch\n\n- Fabian Schmengler\n\n- Vladyslav Podorozhnyi\n\n- and so many more\n\n## What's Next?\n\n### Our Vision for Mage-OS\n\nThe Mage-OS Distribution is an upstream compatible metapackage based on Magento Open Source. Think of it as an independent version of Magento—based on Magento source code, but including additional changes specific to Mage-OS.\n\nThe purpose of the Mage-OS core distribution is to provide\n\n- Improved decoupling of packages\n\n- Improved developer experience while working with the product\n\n- Improved developer experience while contributing to the product\n\n- Full compatibility with Magento extensions\n\n- Focus on additional security\n\n- Reduced infrastructure stack dependencies\n\n- Low-level code improvements, for example in the areas of code generation and caching\n\n- Removal of most bundled extensions contained in upstream (they can still be independently installed if desired)\n\n- A simple documented migration path to Magento Open Source or Adobe Commerce\n\nMage-OS Distribution releases are made independently of upstream releases. This enables us to move faster when desired, for example when enabling compatibility with new PHP versions.\n\nNew functional features will be introduced through independently installable modules. This follows the same decoupling approach that Adobe Commerce is using, allowing for a more stable core and an independent feature module release schedule.\n\nThe goal of the reduced infrastructure stack dependencies is to enable new developers to be onboarded more easily. The goal is to be able to use a plain XAMPP stack on any machine, including Windows, to run and develop with Mage-OS. This requires making Elasticsearch optional, as well as ensuring services like Redis, RabbitMQ, Node.js and such remain optional.\n\nMage-OS will also maintain backwards compatibility and the ability to migrate upstream at multiple levels:\n\n- Compatibility with third-party extensions\n\n- Database level compatibility (data and schema)\n\n- API stability\n\nAll of our work on [creating custom releases based on Magento](https://github.com/mage-os/generate-mirror-repo-js) is open source, meaning:\n\n1. Mage-OS builds can be independently built and verified, and are fully reproducible;\n\n2. If you want to create your own fork and version of Magento or Mage-OS, you can do that too.\n\n### Up Next: Mage-OS Flavored Distributions\n\nSoon, we will be working toward producing different 'flavors' of Mage-OS. These flavors will be different bundles of Mage-OS packages, for specific purposes. For example:\n\n- The Mage-OS headless distribution might contain no storefront theme\n\n- The Mage-OS minimal distribution might contain only a minimal set of packages to enable building lightweight applications\n\n- The Mage-OS headful distribution might contain no GraphQL packages\n\nFundamentally these will be the same Mage-OS/Magento you've come to know and love, but without features that don't apply to a given use case -- and maybe with additional features that use case uniquely benefits from. In the process, Mage-OS will become more performant, more flexible, and appeal to an even broader market.\n\nOur goal is also to allow others to create their own 'distributions as 'flavored' distributions too.\n\n## Contribute\n\nAre you interested in contributing to Mage-OS, or have a bug or improvement you'd like to make? We're open for pull requests now at [https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2)!\n\nIf you have a bigger project in mind, please [join Discord](http://chat.mage-os.org) and summarize your idea in #discussions.

Toll, right?\n\n- Vinai, Fabian, Vlad - these three musketeers made the Mage-OS Release Process even cooler, creating custom distributions.\n\n- Maryna and Rico? Ah, artists! They gave a new face to Mage-OS DevDocs, and shared knowledge on contributor workflows.\n\n- Tjitje, he was a busy bee with PHP Codestyle GitHub Action, making things faster with a Baseline.\n\n- Matthias, our hero, made Elasticsearch optional. A big, big move!\n\n- Laura, she was our sunshine. Taking photos, making everyone smile. Ein wunderbar person!\n\n**Much Work, Much Results!**  \nIn such short time, can you believe, we merged about 35 PRs across 8 repositories? It’s like magic!\n\n**And Fun Times?

It was great to connect with so many of you and share in your hopes and dreams.\n\nWe got a lot of questions from people during the conference, and maybe you've thought them too. Here are our answers, if so!\n\nHave more questions? Check out our [FAQ](/?page_id=320), or ask away at [chat.mage-os.org](http://chat.mage-os.org)! We’re an open book.\n\nWhy should I recommend Mage-OS over Magento?\n\nThe Mage-OS Distribution is still just getting started, and so right now there are not a lot of differences between it and Magento Open Source. The first release of Mage-OS already includes a number of improvements, so merchants who like using the bleeding edge are welcome to build on Mage-OS.\n\nAt Mage-OS we’re focusing on platform improvements, enhancements, and rapid progress that builds on top of the long-term stability that Magento provides. Both platforms give you full access to the complete ecosystem of Magento providers, extensions, and integrations.\n\nAt this time, using Magento Open Source is a great option for most merchants. It’s a great platform for merchants, and more stable and secure than it’s ever been. Should the requirements change, it will always be possible to migrate to Mage-OS at a later time.\n\nWill Mage-OS have a very different code base than Magento? How will that impact developers and extensions?\n\nOur mission has always been to support the whole Magento ecosystem and allow it to thrive. As such we will always take into account the interests of merchants, agencies, extension vendors, and other service providers that need an easy integration path to the platform.\n\nOur intention is to keep the Mage-OS Distribution as compatible as possible with Magento extensions and solutions, for as long as possible. There will be differences as fixes and improvements are made to Mage-OS, but those should be of limited scope and won’t involve major changes to the nature of how Magento works.\n\nAny solutions that work for Magento should also work for Mage-OS with little or no changes, and anyone that learns Magento or Mage-OS programming will be able to work with the other too.\n\nWe are also working with some extension vendors, like Amasty. By testing their extensions on Mage-OS we gather valuable insight in compatibility. We welcome any extension vendors and integrators to join the effort and do the same.\n\nWith Adobe not marketing Magento, who’s going to take that on?\n\nGood question! This is right up the alley of Magento Association, and they’re jumping right into that with the creation of a new magento-opensource.com website for the purpose. If you’re interested in getting involved with that, get in touch with the MA Content Committee.\n\nWe are focusing mostly on the technical and business sides of the ecosystem. Marketing, outreach, and sales can be expensive. Between wanting to put our resources to the best use, and not having access to the Magento brand, we believe our efforts are best spent strengthening the platform and ecosystem.\n\nHow will Mage-OS not distract from the progress of Magento Association?\n\nWe’re focusing on different things. Our aim is to collaboratively cover all the activities that will help strengthen the Magento ecosystem.\n\nThe Magento Association, which has an agreement with Adobe to use the Magento brand, is focused primarily on the ownership of that brand and everything that goes along with that – marketing, events, content, and outreach. All of those things are massively important! And the MA, Meet Magento, and people involved with them have done a great job with them.\n\nMage-OS is focused primarily on enhancement, longevity, and innovation of the Magento platform. That includes bug fixes, performance improvements, modernization, and more. It also means elevating and empowering others in the ecosystem to reach further and work better. We’ll do that through exposure, development tools and workflows, easier setup processes and environments, documentation, and more.\n\nWe are totally open to collaborating with Magento Association where possible, and we are actively discussing with them where and how we can do so.\n\nIf Magento Association is successful, does Mage-OS become redundant?\n\nThe Magento Association’s focus and goals are currently different and distinct from those of Mage-OS (as discussed above). If the Magento Association comes to fulfill all the purposes of Mage-OS, then that’s great! We would love to be redundant. But for now, we expect that the associations will continue in generally the same direction they are now and have very supportive roles.\n\nIf all goes well, success on the part of Magento Association in increasing Magento brand awareness would likely increase adoption of the Mage-OS Distribution in the process, and vice versa.\n\nCould Magento Association start funding Mage-OS as a technology maintainer and incubator?\n\nThat’s not our decision to make, but we’re open to all arrangements that benefit the Magento community.\n\nWhat are three things Mage-OS has learned or will do differently from MA?\n\n- Communication is essential.\n\n- Empowerment is essential.\n\n- Owning your own destiny is essential.\n\nIsn't Mage-OS competing with its agency ecosystem by offering paid services?\n\nMage-OS is run by the community and the agencies and vendors within it. We will not be competing with any integrator or service provider in the ecosystem, to the best of our ability. Our goal is to uplift and support the ecosystem, not cannibalize it, and agencies are a critical part of that. Since Mage-OS is run by the community, the members can ensure any services do not endanger their business.\n\nBy offering service level agreements and extended long-term support for the core platform, our goal is to enable agencies to sell their services to merchants that require vendor support.\n\nThe Mage-OS support company will allow a merchant to pay for a guarantee of support and fixes to the Mage-OS core. It will not extend to any extensions, customizations, integrations, consulting, or development services – all of which would be referred back to the merchant’s agency/developer or to the Mage-OS partners list if they don’t have one.\n\nOur intention is to supplement agency offerings, and enhance the appeal of the Mage-OS/Magento platform to an agency’s merchants and prospects by offloading support responsibility of the core platform. This would function in many ways like Adobe Commerce Support, which every Commerce partner already interacts with.\n\nThis is a major part of our plan for Mage-OS, on several counts:\n\n- Any profit from the support services company will feed back to the Mage-OS Association to put toward development of Mage-OS itself, through development grants and community empowerment.\n\n- Any bug fixes completed in the course of support services will become part of Mage-OS, and available to everyone.\n\n- Software support and reliance can be a major consideration for merchants when deciding on a platform. This is something not directly available to SMB merchants right now, except through Adobe Commerce licensing.\n\nWhat's stopping Mage-OS from getting bought out in the future?\n\nThe Mage-OS Distribution and brand are fully owned by the non-profit Mage-OS Association, and the association is owned and run entirely by its members.\n\nThis was a major consideration of ours when forming Mage-OS, based on the learned experiences of other open source projects. We believe in open source, and believe in Mage-OS staying truly open source. The Mage-OS Association is bound by the operating rules of its legal statutes, and those include member approval for any sale, transfer, or merging of assets or Mage-OS as a whole (per articles 27 and 30 of the [Mage-OS Association statutes](https://mage-os.org/statutes/)).\n\nAny person can become a member of the Mage-OS Association, for as little as 10 EUR a year.\n\nDo we need a new technical roadmap, or do we need organization and marketing around work already underway?\n\nWe believe we need both, and we are working on it from every angle. Please join us! You can help or follow along with everything we’re doing at [chat.mage-os.org](http://chat.mage-os.org) .\n\nDo you think Adobe should relinquish the Magento brand?\n\nWe would love for Adobe to release the Magento brand and trademarks in full to the Magento Association. That being said, it is a valuable asset that Adobe purchased and owns, so we have to be realistic that it’s not likely to happen.\n\nWhat is the most impactful problem that Mage-OS will solve in the next year?\n\nOverall, Mage-OS is working on guaranteeing the longevity of the Magento ecosystem, not on specific individual features.\n\nThere are a number of technical projects we expect to see meaningful progress on within the next year, including reducing technical debt by cleaning up the module dependency graph, a better onboarding experience for new developers, revamping the indexer system, and other performance improvements.\n\nWe believe these improvements will lead to a reduced total cost of ownership for merchants, which in turn will make the ecosystem more competitive for agencies to offer and work with.\n\nWhat about the increased community engagement by Parul Sinha and team?\n\nWe appreciate all the work Parul and the Community Engineering team is doing! Because all changes to Magento Open Source are merged into Mage-OS, every improvement to the platform works to the benefit of all. By all means, people should continue submitting code to Magento and help with processing of pull requests!\n\nThat being said, there are limits to what Adobe will allow to change in Magento Open Source because it’s the foundation of their Adobe Commerce product suite. Essentially, these limitations mean no new meaningful features are likely to come in the core codebase. In the past there have been issues with speed of the contribution cycle and with developer trust, of no fault of Parul or the current Community Engineering team. On both counts, we can help by providing an outlet and processes for developers to fulfill their dreams.\n\nWe are optimistic about collaborating with Magento and the Community Engineering team. Our goal is to ensure that contributions made within Mage-OS are effective and tested in real-world scenarios, so they could be seamlessly integrated into Magento.\n\nWant to learn more or join in?","src/data/post/2023-10-27-mm23ny-follow-up-assoc-interview.md","793810d1aebbfd07",{"html":1277,"metadata":1278},"\u003Cp>Thank you to all that turned out to Meet Magento 2023 in New York!

There will be differences as fixes and improvements are made to Mage-OS, but those should be of limited scope and won’t involve major changes to the nature of how Magento works.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Any solutions that work for Magento should also work for Mage-OS with little or no changes, and anyone that learns Magento or Mage-OS programming will be able to work with the other too.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We are also working with some extension vendors, like Amasty. By testing their extensions on Mage-OS we gather valuable insight in compatibility. We welcome any extension vendors and integrators to join the effort and do the same.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>With Adobe not marketing Magento, who’s going to take that on?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Good question! This is right up the alley of Magento Association, and they’re jumping right into that with the creation of a new magento-opensource.com website for the purpose. If you’re interested in getting involved with that, get in touch with the MA Content Committee.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We are focusing mostly on the technical and business sides of the ecosystem. Marketing, outreach, and sales can be expensive. Between wanting to put our resources to the best use, and not having access to the Magento brand, we believe our efforts are best spent strengthening the platform and ecosystem.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How will Mage-OS not distract from the progress of Magento Association?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We’re focusing on different things. Our aim is to collaboratively cover all the activities that will help strengthen the Magento ecosystem.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Magento Association, which has an agreement with Adobe to use the Magento brand, is focused primarily on the ownership of that brand and everything that goes along with that – marketing, events, content, and outreach. All of those things are massively important! And the MA, Meet Magento, and people involved with them have done a great job with them.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Mage-OS is focused primarily on enhancement, longevity, and innovation of the Magento platform. That includes bug fixes, performance improvements, modernization, and more. It also means elevating and empowering others in the ecosystem to reach further and work better. We’ll do that through exposure, development tools and workflows, easier setup processes and environments, documentation, and more.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We are totally open to collaborating with Magento Association where possible, and we are actively discussing with them where and how we can do so.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If Magento Association is successful, does Mage-OS become redundant?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Magento Association’s focus and goals are currently different and distinct from those of Mage-OS (as discussed above). If the Magento Association comes to fulfill all the purposes of Mage-OS, then that’s great! We would love to be redundant. But for now, we expect that the associations will continue in generally the same direction they are now and have very supportive roles.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If all goes well, success on the part of Magento Association in increasing Magento brand awareness would likely increase adoption of the Mage-OS Distribution in the process, and vice versa.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Could Magento Association start funding Mage-OS as a technology maintainer and incubator?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That’s not our decision to make, but we’re open to all arrangements that benefit the Magento community.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are three things Mage-OS has learned or will do differently from MA?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Communication is essential.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Empowerment is essential.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Owning your own destiny is essential.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>Isn’t Mage-OS competing with its agency ecosystem by offering paid services?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Mage-OS is run by the community and the agencies and vendors within it. We will not be competing with any integrator or service provider in the ecosystem, to the best of our ability. Our goal is to uplift and support the ecosystem, not cannibalize it, and agencies are a critical part of that. Since Mage-OS is run by the community, the members can ensure any services do not endanger their business.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>By offering service level agreements and extended long-term support for the core platform, our goal is to enable agencies to sell their services to merchants that require vendor support.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Mage-OS support company will allow a merchant to pay for a guarantee of support and fixes to the Mage-OS core. It will not extend to any extensions, customizations, integrations, consulting, or development services – all of which would be referred back to the merchant’s agency/developer or to the Mage-OS partners list if they don’t have one.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Our intention is to supplement agency offerings, and enhance the appeal of the Mage-OS/Magento platform to an agency’s merchants and prospects by offloading support responsibility of the core platform. This would function in many ways like Adobe Commerce Support, which every Commerce partner already interacts with.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is a major part of our plan for Mage-OS, on several counts:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Any profit from the support services company will feed back to the Mage-OS Association to put toward development of Mage-OS itself, through development grants and community empowerment.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Any bug fixes completed in the course of support services will become part of Mage-OS, and available to everyone.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Software support and reliance can be a major consideration for merchants when deciding on a platform. This is something not directly available to SMB merchants right now, except through Adobe Commerce licensing.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>What’s stopping Mage-OS from getting bought out in the future?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Mage-OS Distribution and brand are fully owned by the non-profit Mage-OS Association, and the association is owned and run entirely by its members.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This was a major consideration of ours when forming Mage-OS, based on the learned experiences of other open source projects. We believe in open source, and believe in Mage-OS staying truly open source. The Mage-OS Association is bound by the operating rules of its legal statutes, and those include member approval for any sale, transfer, or merging of assets or Mage-OS as a whole (per articles 27 and 30 of the \u003Ca href=\"https://mage-os.org/statutes/\">Mage-OS Association statutes\u003C/a>).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Any person can become a member of the Mage-OS Association, for as little as 10 EUR a year.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Do we need a new technical roadmap, or do we need organization and marketing around work already underway?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We believe we need both, and we are working on it from every angle. Please join us! You can help or follow along with everything we’re doing at \u003Ca href=\"http://chat.mage-os.org\">chat.mage-os.org\u003C/a> .\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Do you think Adobe should relinquish the Magento brand?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We would love for Adobe to release the Magento brand and trademarks in full to the Magento Association. That being said, it is a valuable asset that Adobe purchased and owns, so we have to be realistic that it’s not likely to happen.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What is the most impactful problem that Mage-OS will solve in the next year?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Overall, Mage-OS is working on guaranteeing the longevity of the Magento ecosystem, not on specific individual features.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There are a number of technical projects we expect to see meaningful progress on within the next year, including reducing technical debt by cleaning up the module dependency graph, a better onboarding experience for new developers, revamping the indexer system, and other performance improvements.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We believe these improvements will lead to a reduced total cost of ownership for merchants, which in turn will make the ecosystem more competitive for agencies to offer and work with.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What about the increased community engagement by Parul Sinha and team?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We appreciate all the work Parul and the Community Engineering team is doing! Because all changes to Magento Open Source are merged into Mage-OS, every improvement to the platform works to the benefit of all. By all means, people should continue submitting code to Magento and help with processing of pull requests!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That being said, there are limits to what Adobe will allow to change in Magento Open Source because it’s the foundation of their Adobe Commerce product suite. Essentially, these limitations mean no new meaningful features are likely to come in the core codebase. In the past there have been issues with speed of the contribution cycle and with developer trust, of no fault of Parul or the current Community Engineering team. On both counts, we can help by providing an outlet and processes for developers to fulfill their dreams.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We are optimistic about collaborating with Magento and the Community Engineering team. Our goal is to ensure that contributions made within Mage-OS are effective and tested in real-world scenarios, so they could be seamlessly integrated into Magento.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Want to learn more or join in?\u003C/p>",{"headings":1279,"localImagePaths":1280,"remoteImagePaths":1281,"frontmatter":1282,"imagePaths":1285},[],[],[],{"title":1271,"publishDate":1283,"category":18,"author":19,"draft":15,"excerpt":1272,"readingTime":1284},"2023-10-27T00:00:00.000Z",9,[],"2023-10-31-meet-magento-nyc-2023-a-gathering-of-the-mage-os-community",{"id":1286,"data":1288,"body":1292,"filePath":1293,"digest":1294,"rendered":1295},{"publishDate":1289,"draft":15,"title":1290,"excerpt":1291,"category":18,"author":19},["Date","2023-10-31T00:00:00.000Z"],"Meet Magento NYC 2023: A Gathering of the Mage-OS Community","October’s cool New York City breeze witnessed the confluence of Magento aficionados.

Nestled in the heart of the city, the New World stage off-broadway theater came alive on 10th and 11th October 2023 with the electric vibe of Meet Magento NYC.\n\n## Kickstarting with the Pre-Party\n\nBefore the main event even began, the tone was set with a pre-party on Monday evening, giving everyone a chance to mingle and set the mood for the impending conference. There was a great turnout and this was the first time many of the Mage-OS board and contributors met in person, which was a great moment. A big thank you to ShipperHQ for sponsoring/hosting and crafting such a welcoming and energetic start to our week.\n\n## Mage-OS Booth: The Epicenter of Activity\n\nTuesday saw the venue buzzing with enthusiasts. The Mage-OS booth emerged as a popular spot, thanks to Ryan Hoerr’s commendable management. It was heartening to see notable Mage-OS stalwarts like David Lambauer, Damien Retzinger, Anton Kril, Jakub Winkler, and John Hughes rally around, amplifying the energy.\n\n![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Mage-OS-Booth-1-1024x991.jpg)\n\n## Innovating Magento: Damien's Revelation\n\nThe afternoon sessions commenced with one of our longest-serving and most active technical contributors, Damien Ratzinger, who gave an enlightening and in-depth talk on NX. The promise? Making Magento a whopping 1000x faster. An interesting note: this groundbreaking tech is currently the pride of Mage-OS and is regularly discussed in our weekly technical meetings, with contributions ongoing (and more welcome!)\n\n![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Damien-1-1024x991.jpg)\n\n## AI & Devdocs: David’s Journey\n\nDavid Lambauer later took center stage, narrating his compelling journey to create the Mage-OS DevDocs. The awe-inspiring aspect? A massive 70,000 words, crafted with a sprinkle of AI magic. But it wasn’t just about quantity. The revamped devdocs are meticulously designed with newcomers in mind, emphasizing developer friendliness. Enhanced with Algolia doc search, finding information has never been more seamless. And the best part? Contributing to the DevDocs is now as effortless as clicking a single button.\n\n![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/David-1-1024x968.jpg)\n\n## Blazing Fast Catalog Performance: Ivan’s Mission\n\nYet another long-term Mage-OS tech contributor and one of the original Magento core developers, Ivan Chepurnyi, also focused on performance. This time in relation to catalog data processing and streaming optimization, showing how his solution can reduce data indexation times from multiple hours to a few seconds!\n\n## Mage-OS & Magento Association: A Symbiotic Dialogue\n\nThe day reached its zenith with a fireside (panel) chat about the current state of the Magento ecosystem and the synergy between Mage-OS and the Magento Association. Kudos to our Board Member Ryan Hoerr for representing Mage-OS. Not to forget, Matthias Schreiber, Executive Director at the Magento Association, who painted a promising picture of the association’s future too.\n\nThere were also many burning (and some controversial) questions submitted from the audience (and farther afield) that weren't answered on the day due to time constraints. However, we felt these were important to respond to, which is why we spent time collectively reviewing these questions, which culminated in us recently publishing a [follow up article](/?p=3013) to outline our responses.\n\n![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/whats-Up-Magento-1-1024x768.jpg)\n\n## An Evening of Camaraderie\n\nWhile there was no official post-conference celebration on the evening of the first night, the spirit of community was too strong. Attendees formed spontaneous groups, cherishing the NYC culinary scene and forging connections over delightful dinners and engaging debate.\n\n## The Chronicles of Mage-OS\n\nDiving straight into Wednesday, the day was enriched with informative sessions. The standout was undoubtedly our Board Member John Hughes enlightening the audience on the essence of Mage-OS. From its humble beginnings, the current achievements (such as our initial Mage-Os Distribution release and recent membership rollout), to a future shimmering with promise - the narrative was both engaging and insightful.\n\n![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Mage_OS-1-1024x767.jpg)\n\n## Bowling & Bonding: An After-Party to Remember\n\nAs day turned to evening, the ambiance shifted from formal to fun. Attendees were treated to an after-party with a twist - a bowling alley setting. Not just pins and balls; there was a delectable spread to satiate the foodies. But the night was young, and the energy unyielding.\n\n## Midnight Tales at The Perfect Pint\n\nPost bowling, many ventured to The Perfect Pint, a charming pub that would be a recurring locale. Here, amidst clinks of glasses and hearty laughter, conversations flowed seamlessly, stretching till 3 am. Tales were exchanged, memories forged, and Magento stories shared under the dim lights of the pub.\n\n![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Perfect-Pint-1-1024x768.jpg)\n\n![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Perfect-Pint-2-2-1-689x1024.jpg)\n\n## Mage-OS Meetup: Concluding with a Bang\n\nThursday, though signaling the end, was far from a winding down. The Perfect Pint once again played host, this time to the Mage-OS & Friends Get Together. The week might have been packed, but the enthusiasm was undiminished. A substantial crowd turned up, proving that when it comes to Mage-OS, the community’s spirit is indefatigable.\n\n![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Concluding-1-1024x549.jpg)\n\n## Takeaways: Many Thanks & Food For Thought\n\nFirstly, a big thank you to Marsha Naidoo and the team at Above the Fray, not just for being incredible event hosts and organizers, but for supporting our presence on every level and allowing us to make a real splash in the US market. The event was an undeniable success for all involved and everyone deserves recognition, from the talented speakers, the sponsors who make these events possible, the organizers who made it a reality, to each and every one of the attendees - as there would not be events without you!\n\nSecondly, the event was incredibly insightful for us and we had many stimulating, and even at times some heated (but all good-natured), debates that have helped us learn and reflect on our mission and goals and we’ve come away with a renewed purpose and a focus on positivity and better collaboration within the ecosystem (such as with the Magento Association and Adobe), while not inhibiting our desire for rapid change and improvement with our recently released [Mage-OS Distribution](/?p=2838).\n\nUntil the next event!

Thursday, November...","> This post was written and submitted by Jisse Reitsma, Chair of [Mage-OS Nederland](https://nl.mage-os.org/https://nl.mage-os.org/), in conjunction with our global marketing working group.\n\nThursday, November 2nd 2023, it happened. Again. [Meet Magento Netherlands (MMNL)](https://nl.meet-magento.com/) took place. And what a success. Tickets were sold out, everyone was blown away (literally), enthusiasm was great. The Dutch are truly back!\n\n## Quick overview\n\nMeet Magento NL was organized by a fresh team where the members originated from various agencies, backed by the new Mage-OS Nederland association (keep reading), based entirely on voluntary effort - so: non-profit. \n\nThe event took place in Amsterdam, at the venue of LIEF Amsterdam, which was great on the inside and which would have been great on the outside, if it were not for the southwestern storm that raged across The Netherlands. And as for rage, the entire event was just outrageously fun.\n\n## A first (new) Meet Magento NL?\n\nThe last Meet Magento NL (before this one) was ages ago (about 4 years ago). Nothing happened in between due to a different structure of the ecosystem, COVID and life. For many who attended this year's MMNL edition, this was actually the first Meet Magento event they ever attended: The ecosystem sees many that come and many that leave, a healthy thing if I could say so. \n\nAnd with so many attending a Meet Magento event for the very first time (by show of hands, at least 100 people), it really gives you the feeling that Magento is not dead yet. We are experiencing a \\*[Magento renaissance](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/time-magento-renaissance-jakub-winkler-ce2xf)\\* (trademark: Jakub Winkler).\n\nTo others (like myself), it felt like a homecoming. It was great to see so many familiar faces again, to hug friends. But the event also felt very different: Different people that organized the event, new venue, newcomers (as mentioned), an ecosystem that evolved, a different vibe. And everything with a touch of Mage-OS flavor.\n\n## Backed, but not organized by Mage-OS Nederland\n\nVarious sessions were focused on Mage-OS, many were focused on Hyvä. No further introduction needed. However, the event was co-organized by Mage-OS Nederland and this was another way to see that this year's MMNL was different from earlier editions. No more company-owned communities. Instead, a new Mage-OS Nederland association. \n\nEarlier in 2023, [Mage-OS NL was founded](https://nl.mage-os.org/nl/vereniging) by a group of seven individuals (me included) which are now forming the board. Next, the association organized various community drinks. And it helped create MageUnconference NL, organized by Yireo (me).\n\nIn the same way, MMNL was put together. Not necessarily by Mage-OS Nederland though. The new association's task is to facilitate the community, to bring together people, to inform people on the state of the ecosystem. However, we decided that it would be better if the association would be more about governing instead of doing the actual thing.\n\n![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/team-2-1024x683.jpg)\n\nWith that, two board members - Core and Sanne - stepped up to organize MMNL and the rest of the board mainly took on a supporting role. Core and Sanne assembled a group of ten volunteers and with that the MMNL team became a real thing.\n\nBig thank you to our ten MM23NL organizers\n\n1. [Sanne Bolkenstein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanne-bolkenstein-12079726/)\n\n2. [Core de Reeper](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABPjuSABZBldyz5mp4bLSODwT8S8p6xoKno)\n\n3.  [Danny Verkade](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAB9QvcBNjD0lYsKQLVTe4jmwjdMaqllu00)\n\n4.  [Danny Uranka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAd1A7oBal6qYB9RrZxb63DXTfFsecK1V90)\n\n5.  [Dominique de Maa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAACjZe0BIlcIAakmgaqmHszLRNEQNZDa1SU)\n\n6.  [Charif Eddini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABH9oOEBUUxPiDXyW_xcMFWg0EQ39dcD9gg)\n\n7.  [Henk de Gier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAPD49UBNG1OzCe7CctlVv09miQnyduy9yY)\n\n8.  [Jelle Siderius](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABB5hRwBs4G3X55ZapZlWJWdK7cGc1DvJps)\n\n9.  [Jelle van Genderen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAB_4wOEB6q-Jt_7x36EH3eTcP-CE9YVVUvY) \n\n10. [Tom Ketels](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABlRWw0BZ4rGopCQDSPmJ7MGWR_5yhpLzdI)\n\nI'm kind of glad that it went this way. The board doesn't become solely responsible for events in The Netherlands: It only makes sure that people are able to organize events in such a manner that as many people as possible are reached. And on the other hand, \\*anyone\\* is able to create an event and have it backed up by Mage-OS Nederland, as long as the event is helping out the Magento / Adobe Commerce / Mage-OS ecosystem.\n\nAll in all, I'm so happy that we actually reached two very important social goals this year: We formed a board. And an event team for Meet Magento organically came to being!\n\n## Carried by the Dutch Magento community\n\n![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Jisse-1024x811.jpg)\n\nOh and we organized a Meet Magento. And not \\*we\\* as in a small group of people. But \\*we\\* as in a large group of Magento fans: The board of seven. The Meet Magento NL team of ten. But also a large group of sponsors that stood up as one to make sure the event was financially doable (with the association having zero budget to begin with). And a group of speakers. And a group of people listening to speakers. The event really brought everyone together.\n\nAnd I would say that the reboot of the Dutch Magento ecosystem is now fully in effect: MageUnconf, hackathon, Meet Magento, Webwinkel Vakdagen drinks, an association. We are back!\n\nAlso a big thank you to our sponsors, huge and strong supporters of Open Source and of our Magento Community:\n\n- [Mollie](https://www.mollie.com/)\n\n- [Tweakwise](https://www.tweakwise.com/nl/)\n\n- [Hyvä](https://www.hyva.io/)\n\n- [Hypernode](https://www.hypernode.com/nl/)\n\n- [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/)\n\n- [Adyen](https://www.adyen.com/nl_NL)\n\n- [Ergonode](https://www.ergonode.com/)\n\n- [Storeframe](https://www.storeframe.io/)\n\n- [Leadinfo](https://www.leadinfo.com/nl/)\n\n- [Cream](https://cream.nl/)\n\n- [Etales](https://www.e-tales.nl/)\n\n- [Rumvision](https://www.rumvision.com/)\n\n- [Vendic](https://vendic.nl/)\n\n- [HYPR](https://www.hypershop.nl/)\n\n- [Youwe](https://www.youweagency.nl/)\n\n- [Sansec](https://sansec.io/)\n\n- [Enrise](https://enrise.com/)\n\n- [Emico](https://www.emico.nl/)\n\n- [Magmodules](https://www.magmodules.nl/)\n\n- [Elgentos](https://elgentos.nl/)\n\nFor more fun pictures taken across the Community, use the hashtag #MM23NL on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mage-os) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mage_os).\n\n## We Are Magento\n\nWe were delighted to come together as the whole Magento ecosystem. Mathias Schreiber from the Magento Association joined us for the whole day including a speaking session sharing all the latest updates on his end. Thank you to Dewi Wassenaar from Adobe for coming and supporting us as a local. Vinai Kopp also shared updates about Mage-OS, the international organization, in his closing remarks, highlighting how we need to all collaborate with Adobe and the Magento Association. Stay tuned on that one!\n\n![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/mv-1024x815.jpg)\n\n## What is next?\n\nThe year is almost over and we are making plans already for next year: Meet Magento NL will be repeated on October 31st, 2024 - most likely again in Amsterdam. But earlier that year, there will be plenty of other opportunities to meet up: \n\nThe Webwinkel Vakdagen will take place on 23rd and 24th of January 2024, with most likely at the end of the first day community drinks in Uncle Jim, Utrecht. Somewhere early 2024, the association will organize a new second member meeting. And there might very well be a MageTitans Groningen 2024. We'll keep you informed.\n\nWant to meet the [Dutch Magento community](https://discord.gg/SAeHwfJF)? You got plenty of opportunities!\n\nWant to know where you can hang out with Mage-OS globally?

Nothing happened in between due to a different structure of the ecosystem, COVID and life. For many who attended this year’s MMNL edition, this was actually the first Meet Magento event they ever attended: The ecosystem sees many that come and many that leave, a healthy thing if I could say so. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And with so many attending a Meet Magento event for the very first time (by show of hands, at least 100 people), it really gives you the feeling that Magento is not dead yet. We are experiencing a *\u003Ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/time-magento-renaissance-jakub-winkler-ce2xf\">Magento renaissance\u003C/a>* (trademark: Jakub Winkler).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To others (like myself), it felt like a homecoming. It was great to see so many familiar faces again, to hug friends. But the event also felt very different: Different people that organized the event, new venue, newcomers (as mentioned), an ecosystem that evolved, a different vibe. And everything with a touch of Mage-OS flavor.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"backed-but-not-organized-by-mage-os-nederland\">Backed, but not organized by Mage-OS Nederland\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Various sessions were focused on Mage-OS, many were focused on Hyvä. No further introduction needed. However, the event was co-organized by Mage-OS Nederland and this was another way to see that this year’s MMNL was different from earlier editions. No more company-owned communities. Instead, a new Mage-OS Nederland association. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Earlier in 2023, \u003Ca href=\"https://nl.mage-os.org/nl/vereniging\">Mage-OS NL was founded\u003C/a> by a group of seven individuals (me included) which are now forming the board. Next, the association organized various community drinks. And it helped create MageUnconference NL, organized by Yireo (me).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In the same way, MMNL was put together. Not necessarily by Mage-OS Nederland though. The new association’s task is to facilitate the community, to bring together people, to inform people on the state of the ecosystem. However, we decided that it would be better if the association would be more about governing instead of doing the actual thing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/team-2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>With that, two board members - Core and Sanne - stepped up to organize MMNL and the rest of the board mainly took on a supporting role. Core and Sanne assembled a group of ten volunteers and with that the MMNL team became a real thing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Big thank you to our ten MM23NL organizers\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanne-bolkenstein-12079726/\">Sanne Bolkenstein\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABPjuSABZBldyz5mp4bLSODwT8S8p6xoKno\">Core de Reeper\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp> \u003Ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAB9QvcBNjD0lYsKQLVTe4jmwjdMaqllu00\">Danny Verkade\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp> \u003Ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAd1A7oBal6qYB9RrZxb63DXTfFsecK1V90\">Danny Uranka\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp> \u003Ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAACjZe0BIlcIAakmgaqmHszLRNEQNZDa1SU\">Dominique de Maa\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp> \u003Ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABH9oOEBUUxPiDXyW_xcMFWg0EQ39dcD9gg\">Charif Eddini\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp> \u003Ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAPD49UBNG1OzCe7CctlVv09miQnyduy9yY\">Henk de Gier\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp> \u003Ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABB5hRwBs4G3X55ZapZlWJWdK7cGc1DvJps\">Jelle Siderius\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp> \u003Ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAB_4wOEB6q-Jt_7x36EH3eTcP-CE9YVVUvY\">Jelle van Genderen\u003C/a> \u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABlRWw0BZ4rGopCQDSPmJ7MGWR_5yhpLzdI\">Tom Ketels\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Cp>I’m kind of glad that it went this way.

The big news from October is the initial release of the Mage-OS...","Another month in 2023 has passed, and yet again, we’ve got lots of updates to bring you! The big news from October is the initial release of the Mage-OS Distribution, but we’ve also got details on our recently launched membership offering as well community updates from recent (and upcoming) events.\n\n## Mage-OS Distribution Initial Release!\n\nA huge milestone was met this month. After more than a year of work with an increasing number of passionate and talented volunteers, our technical team has released the first version of the Mage-OS Distribution. Until now, we’ve offered mirrors of Magento Open Source, including our unique nightly builds, but as the name suggests, these mirrors simply provide an alternative way to install and manage the same Magento Open Source codebase.\n\nHowever, with this release, we now have a completely standalone distribution. While this still includes Magento Open Source, we can implement additional modifications, paving the way for us to differentiate our offering with new functionality, along with enhancements and bug fixes.\n\n![Mage-OS Admin Panel Login Screen](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/270081063-353abb42-ab86-4e4f-810c-ad005148cb48-1024x465.png)\n\nWhile the initial version only includes a handful of changes, including refreshed admin panel branding, we plan to roll out further (and more impactful) changes over time, as they are contributed from the open source community.\n\n[Want To Contribute? Get Involved](/?page_id=331)\n\nWhile we are now forging our own path, we will maintain compatibility with Magento Open Source, ensuring that all your existing extensions and integrations are supported. We also aim to ensure compatibility updates are rolled out as swiftly as possible, which is highlighted by our adding support for the 2.4.6-p3 patch release, which was released within 24 hours of our initial launch, meaning we released 1.0.1 already!\n\nFor more details, read our [full announcement](/?p=2838) article, which includes installation/migration steps.\n\n## Membership\n\nIn [last month's update](/?p=2801), we announced the soft launch of our membership offering, which has already raised over €8,000 in our first month. A big thank you to all our initial backers.\n\n![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Open-Collective-Initial-Backers-1024x576.png)\n\nWhen we launched, we supported credit/debit card payments only, but we’ve now added bank transfer/direct bank payment offerings to aid larger contributions, plus reduce the fees paid (i.e. ensuring more of your contribution money goes to Mage-OS).\n\nThis initial rollout has given us some insight into the quirks around the platform we use to manage contributions (Open Collective), and as such, we’re working on a detailed guide to help simplify the process of signing up and clarify intricacies, like the tip system that benefits Open Collective (not Mage-OS).\n\nIf you want a reminder on our different membership (individual) and partner (business) tiers, then head over to our [Membership](/?page_id=384) page to find out more.\n\n[Support Mage-OS](/?page_id=384)\n\n## Community Feedback\n\nNow that the Magento event season is in full swing, we took the opportunity to get exposure and raise awareness and comprehension of what Mage-OS is, why we exist and why others should consider supporting/joining us.\n\nBurning questions were asked at [MageUnconference in Cologne](/?p=2903) and Meet Magento New York [Meet Magento New York](/?p=3049) (see recaps below), and this provided a lot of food for thought to our team, especially around how to provide more clarity about our vision and roadmap.\n\nOne key point that we can address straight away is the collaboration between Adobe, the Magento Association and Mage-OS. Although our original movement came from the frustration of feeling less support from Adobe, we are now in a different space.\n\nWe acknowledge all the efforts put in since, with the appointment of Mathias Schreiber on the Magento Association side, as well as Parul Sinha and Ritesh Somani on the Adobe side. We are also very thankful to the whole Meet Magento events team for their continuous effort to allow the Community to all gather in person and nurture our shared passion. We are very grateful that the organizers of various events like Meet Commerce, [Mage Titans](/?p=1658), Mage Unconference NL and [DE](/?p=2903), the [Mage-OS Hackathon](/?p=2633) and [Meet Magento New York](/?p=3049) have welcomed Mage-OS with open arms and allowed us to be represented.\n\nWith that in mind, we are now opening up more channels and reaching out more proactively to various stakeholders of the Magento ecosystem to collaborate, ensure our goals are aligned and avoid duplication of work wherever possible. However, in parallel, we will continue to set our own pace as the urgency to maintain and grow the Magento ecosystem and bring reassurance to all stakeholders (e.g. merchants/agencies/vendors) still exists.\n\nWe also pledge to remain open and transparent, and to continue this, we've reviewed all the additional (and unanswered) questions we received during the Q&A session at Meet Magento New York and provided our responses in our [recent update post](/?p=3013).\n\n## Events & Community\n\n### MageUnconference DE\n\nAt the end of September, the legendary MageUnconference returned to Cologne, Germany, and Mage-OS was a hot topic during the weekend, which led to many burning questions (as noted above), plus an influx of new contributors! For more details, see our [recap article](/?p=2903), contributed by attendee and Mage-OS DevDocs creator, David Lambauer.\n\n### Meet Magento New York\n\nThanks to the many of you who joined us at Meet Magento New York! Mage-OS was front and center throughout the 4 days, starting with the pre-party on Monday, through the 2-day main event and into the final day on Thursday, where we hosted our very first in-person meetup: Mage-OS & Friends Get Together.\n\nWe were well represented throughout the event, with our own booth, involvement in multiple panels, as well as talk covering our journey to date, achievements and future plans. We’d like to extend our thanks to Marsha Naidoo and the team at Above the Fray for supporting our presence on every level and allow us to make a real splash in the US market.\n\nIf you want to learn more, then see our [recap article](/?p=3049) (another shoutout to David Lambauer for helping pull this article together, too!)\n\n### Magento Events Listing and Recaps\n\n![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Event-page-Mage-OS.png)\n\nEvents are an essential part of our community. As such, we feel it is important to provide the go-to place to find all the upcoming Magento events happening around the world. Check out our [Magento events calendar page](/?page_id=368), which is run manually by Mage-OS volunteers and enriched with recaps after each event. Plus, look out for a refreshed events page/system coming soon!\n\nBig thank you to John Prendergast, David Lambauer, and others for this effort.\n\n### Meet Magento Netherlands 2023\n\n![Meet Magento NL Banner](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Art-block.png)\n\nMeet Magento Netherlands is back for 2023 after a 4-year hiatus, and takes place in Amsterdam on November 2nd. This is our last big event for 2023, and we couldn’t be more proud of our Dutch local chapter, [Mage-OS Nederlands](/?page_id=388), for organizing such a successful event before it even takes place! The initial ticket allocation sold out two weeks prior, and further tickets that were made available (thanks to additional sponsors) have now sold out, too. All this means an attendance of over 300 community enthusiasts, which is incredible!\n\nNot only that, but the [lineup of speakers](https://nl.meet-magento.com/programme/) is diverse and features many high-profile merchants and community experts. We’re also very excited about the afterparty, where a live band has been hired to get the dance floor on fire! \n\nAt Mage-OS, we will be well represented, with over half of our board members in attendance - Ignacio, John, Maciej, Thien-Lan, Vinai, and Wouter - plus many more of our valued contributors and working group members. In fact, this may be the biggest gathering of Mage-OS folks to date. So, if you have questions or want to learn more about our plans, this would be an ideal time to ask!\n\nTo round out the day, our president, Vinai, will be taking part in the closing keynote of the event, so don’t miss it!\n\nA big thank you to [all the sponsors](https://nl.meet-magento.com/) for making this event possible.\n\n## Swagshop\n\nFinally, if you’re looking to wear Mage-OS, we have lots of options for you to pick from!

It was sold out two weeks ahead, with over 300 enthusiasts participating. [Read the MM23NL recap](/?p=3117) written by Jisse Reitsma, part of the organizing team.\n\nDespite the weather, the vibe was truly amazing and people within the Community were so happy to connect again.

Many of you have asked for clarity on how we relate to Magento Association, and what it all means for this ecosystem.\n\nOn the Monday after Meet Magento Netherlands, Vinai and Mathias Schreiber met to discuss goals alignment and opportunities for collaboration. [Here is the recap co-written by Vinai and Mathias](/?p=3231) on what came out of this first meeting.\n\nTo strengthen our focus and not dilute the energy of volunteers who contribute actively to our working groups, we felt it was important to look at current roles and responsibilities between Mage-OS and the Magento Association and how we can best collaborate. \n\nHere are some things that we see are specific to the Magento Association: \n\n- Work with Adobe to strengthen Magento Open Source and grow the understanding of the value of Open Source within the corporate environment\n\n- Grow the community through Meet Magento events organization, support and promotion\n\n- Manage Magento Open Source contributors by building the Community Council\n\nWe are delighted that the Magento Association has already launched a brand new **meet-magento.com** website, and are hard at work with the **magento-opensource.com** website. We’re exploring whether that site could leverage some of the content our content group and others have planned and written over the last two years.\n\nOn the Mage-OS end, we keep focusing on:\n\n- Community growth and engagement: we gather more people and bring magic to events, we widen the community's footprint on social media, carrying our positive, open and inclusive values everywhere we go\n\n- Product enhancement: improve our infrastructure so that\n  - the platform is easy and cost effective to maintain\n  - it is rewarding for Magento community members to enrich it with creativity, innovation and Magento mastery\n\n- Product long term support: we plan to set up a commercial entity and provide long term support to the Mage-OS eCommerce platform for merchants of all shapes and sizes.\n\n## Let’s catch up at the following Magento events!\n\n### Europe: Magento Meetup in Aachen, Germany 11th December\n\nSpecial Christmas Edition!\n\n![Aachen Meetup](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Magento_Stammtisch_Aachen_weihnachten_1196930_400x250_8ef2008797-1.png)\n\nBoth Mathias, from the Magento Association, and Vinai, our President, will be there to continue the conversation with you on how we can, together, strengthen the Magento Ecosystem further.\n\nAs for the Christmas feel, there will be fun activities including an escape room and a visit to the historical Aachen city center and local Christmas market.\n\n[Sign up to the Meetup](https://www.integer-net.com/blog_english/magento-meetup-aachen-mage-os-magento-association)\n\n### Europe: Magento Meetup in Poznań, 13th December\n\n![Magento Meetup Poznań](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/poznan-dec-modified.png)\n\nThe long-running Polish Magento Meetup is back in Poznań before the end of the year!

We already gathered nearly 50 women on the **[Mage-Chat Slack channel](https://www.magechat.club/)** sharing some useful tips and lots of good vibes. **Join us by emailing [suzanne@magechat.club](mailto:suzanne@magechat.club)**\n\n2.

Here is a recap, but also some lessons for other local Mage-OS groups to learn from.\n\n## We did it: An association\n\nThe association was started by a group of people in 2022, who wanted to revive the Dutch Magento community after COVID and after some people left. Pretty soon, it was decided to revive things under the hood of a non-profit organization. At first, we subscribed as an informal association. However, the fact that all 7 board members were liable and the fact that bank accounts could only be opened with a formal association, moved us towards a notary and in the end, the association of Mage-OS Nederland was founded for real.\n\nDisclaimer: Mage-OS Nederland its prime objective is to facilitate the Dutch Magento community. This definitely includes organizing Dutch events like Meet Magento Nederland and various other social gatherings. It also includes a proper mapping of the community. Clearing up confusion on the various distributions (Adobe Commerce, Magento Open Source, Mage-OS) could also be part of its activities.\n\nBut Mage-OS Nederland is not part of the open source initiative of Mage-OS. We are part of the same community though. The name Mage-OS Nederland was requested for usage by asking the board of Mage-OS worldwide.\n\nSee also [https://nl.mage-os.org/](https://nl.mage-os.org/) (Dutch and English)\n\n## New board\n\nIn 2022, various Magento community members joined forces - including Jeroen Boersma, Jisse Reitsma, Peter Jaap Blaakmeer, Sander de Graaf, Sanne Bolkenstein and Willem Wigman. In 2023, these people, excluding Peter Jaap and Willem, but with the addition of Core de Reeper, Michiel Gerritsen and Roland Haselager, formed the initial board of Mage-OS NL.\n\nDuring the member meeting of February 29th, Core and Roland stepped down. Jeroen, Jisse, Michiel, Sander and Sanne remained their seat. And Karlijn Löwik and Tabitha Karta joined forces.\n\n## Technical mistakes\n\nHowever, the democratic process of electing the board had some flaws though. Months before the meeting, we started to promote empty board seats. But only one month before, during the WWVD borrel, new candidates were found - that either wanted to be an actual board member or just do something nice for the community. In no time, the amount of candidates went up to 6, which was a bit too much. This led us to say that we only should add 2 board members (a total of 7 or 8) and that all others should be initiated as commissioner of some working group. We didn't think of such an organization yet properly and because of this, we started to rush things. In the end, during the meeting, the board decided to stay seated and to allow for two more board members, which were strongly recommended by the board. No open elections, less democratic. But very practical to keep the energy.\n\nAnother flaw was that the finances were not presented yet before the meeting and there was no audit committee beforehand either. Because of this, the finances couldn't be verified by the audit committee and therefore the board could not be granted discharge.\n\nBecause of these flaws and others, we decided to keep the board large this year, but split it up in two parts: One board-board that dives into the technicalities of running an association. And another board of committees to kickstart all of the work that needs to be done under the hood of the association.\n\n## Our lessons learned\n\nHere are some of the lessons learned so far:\n\nMake sure you start with the right legal form. In our case, opting for a formal association right away would have saved us a lot of time and frustration.\n\nDraft a proper organization. Decide upon the size of the board. Form working groups that are accountable to the board for specific tasks - events, promotion, etc. Every working group should have a lead member (commissioner) and the responsibilities of both board and working groups should be clear from the start. We decided to go for a large board, which is at first okayish but will become more difficult to deal with over time.\n\nPick a small board (president, secretary, treasurer, possibly a fourth member), but make sure that these roles are easily swapped out. Currently with MOSNL, some things are tied to specific persons in the board (president, treasurer), while ideally this is swapped out. Also make sure to agree upon a maximum period for being a board member.\n\nSetup a voting process for board members as detailed as possible. Make sure that candidates are found months in advance. As soon as they are found, even if it is just a single person, start promoting that person publicly. This might attract more candidates.\n\nBecause of all of the above, make sure to setup articles of association, which is a legal requirement in most countries. But it also important to have an agreement with all people involved on how this comes to being.\n\nWithout doubt, there are many more lessons here.\n\n## The why\n\nStill, all of these struggles are worth it: The Dutch Magento community is currently in the hands of an association, not a commercial company. We are free from the copyright of Magento, which is nowadays a thing. And because we are a non-profit organization, it is straight-forward that anyone who is helping the association is doing this for the community its sake.\n\nAlready we are seeing the signs: Meet Magento NL, MageUnconference NL, MageTitans NL. Lots of volunteers to do things. And a healthy kickstart of an association to make all of this possible.","src/data/post/2024-03-07-mage-os-nederland-member-meeting.md","8aafeb10e6cfaced",{"html":1663,"metadata":1664},"\u003Cp>On February 29th (a leap day), the second member meeting of Mage-OS Nederland took place: Hosted at the beautiful venue of De Rechtbank in the center of Utrecht (very close to the famous Dom Tower), a group of about 40 people came together to push the association into a new year.

Gowri is a...","Gowri Sankar is a DevOps engineer from down under with a lot of interest in distributed systems and programming and solving problems at scale. Gowri is a frequent attendee and contributor to Mage-OS via the technical working group.\n\n## **Introduction**\n\nOver the past few months I've been helping out Mage-OS with getting asynchronous events over the finish line. A lot has happened since then. I got to visit Amsterdam and its picturesque canals, experience one of the longest direct flights in the world from Perth to London \\[1\\], enjoy a lot of Dutch pastries and speak at a conference about building real-time webhooks with Magento.\n\nIn this post, I want to build on our work so far, expanding on what asynchronous events are and its applications, and why they’re useful.\n\n## **Event-Driven Architecture**\n\nIf you’ve written a module (or even any framework) before, you’re probably familiar with event observers \\[2\\]. They are a way to write code which reacts to a certain event happening within the system. For example, when a new user signs in, you may want to record their login activity. This in a sense, is an application of event-driven architecture.\n\nIn object-oriented programming it can refer to the observer pattern. In distributed systems it could mean different services communicate asynchronously through a message broker.\n\nThere’s a variety of applications, but the underlying idea is the same. Event-driven architecture is a software design pattern that focuses on the production, consumption, and reaction to events in a system.\n\n## **Integrations**\n\nThere’s one area where event-driven architecture can shine in Magento and it is integrations. Currently, there are many different and often bespoke approaches when sending data out of Magento.\n\nI’ve often seen integrations that are file-based where a simple cron job runs on a schedule and writes to /var. This is far from ideal for many reasons. There’s also network-based integrations that’s akin to a single system or a vendor. For example, a payment provider’s module will likely only be able to send data out to their own services.\n\nThere’s an obvious problem here though. The framework doesn’t provide any standard tooling. A module’s author is responsible for managing how that data is pulled out. It could be file-based, FTP, HTTP or with emails if you’d like to live on the edge.\n\nThen there’s the murky problem of error handling. Anything that can go wrong will go wrong. The external system could be in a scheduled maintenance window, have an outage or even have network packets lost in transit. It is within the module to decide how failures should be handled. It could take the simple route of simply logging it to a custom log file, to a more sophisticated approach of having a retry job somewhere.\n\nThey also need to be more flexible. If I wanted to send the same event to a second system, a third and a fourth, chances are I’ll have to modify the module each time and deploy the changes. If I want to send a different set of data but to an existing system(s), that’s again another deployment.\n\nI would also be confident in saying that observability is the one thing that’s nearly impossible to achieve in integrations today. There simply isn’t a way to collect any sort of metrics to later pull up a dashboard and say “Ok, how many individual integrations have failed, where, when and why?” I believe we can do far better than looking through thousands of lines of error log files or emails to an error inbox saying something failed.\n\nIt’s also far from ideal when we’re migrating between systems. For example, if we had customer platform A and we’re migrating to customer platform B, we’d likely have to install platform B’s module alongside platform A. Make them work together for a while, and then at some time in the future, disable and remove platform A’s module.\n\nThat’s already a fair few points that describe the subpar developer, operations and merchant experience.\n\nWe would like our integrations to be\n\n1. Fast and scalable, so we can have a high throughput stream of events enabling real-time systems like webhooks.\n\n2. Fault-tolerant. If something fails, it shouldn’t be lost in an ocean of events. We should be able to retry as many times as we want automatically and manually.\n\n3. Flexible such that modifications don’t need a code change and a deployment.\n\n4. Observable so that we can add telemetry tools to collect and aggregate metrics.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\n![Gowri speaking at Meet Magento NL](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/gowri-mmnl-talk-684x1024.jpg)\n\n\u003Cfigcaption>\n\nGowri speaking at Meet Magento NL\n\n\u003C/figcaption>\n\n\u003C/figure>\n\n## **Streaming Events**\n\nWith the asynchronous events module, it’s possible to build a real-time webhooks delivery system like GitHub, Stripe or Shopify. Webhooks are a perfect candidate to build an event-driven integration system because it is possible to make them real-time, observable and fault-tolerant.\n\nTo provide some more flavour of what I’m talking about, we can look at how a webhook-based integration system addresses the shortcomings we just discussed.\n\n1. Webhooks powered by asynchronous events run in a dedicated queue consumer process. It’s possible to offload this entirely off of your main web server.\n\n2. Asynchronous events are fault-tolerant by default. The framework will retry retryable errors (think 50x error codes for HTTP) with exponential backoff.\n\n3. Asynchronous events are subscription-based, it’s possible to add or disable subscriptions without needing to touch code or do a deployment.\n\n4. Events are recorded in a log and they are optionally indexed into Elasticsearch, which makes it a breeze to query failures and anomalies with queries.\n\nAt its core, the module provides a framework to define events that can be listened to outside of the main request thread in Magento. When we talk about asynchronous, we’re actually talking about this and not promises or futures found in other languages.\n\nDefining an asynchronous event is similar to a regular event.\n\n```\n\u003C?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n\n\u003Cconfig\n\n    xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n\n    xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:module:MageOS_AsyncEvents:etc/async_events.xsd\"\n\n>\n\n    \u003Casync_event name=\"sales.order.created\">\n\n        \u003Cservice class=\"Magento\\Sales\\Api\\OrderRepositoryInterface\" method=\"get\"/>\n\n    \u003C/async_event>\n\n\u003C/config>\n```\n\nSimilar to an event observer, an async event has a name. The service class and method define what the shape of the event’s data should resolve to (Remember that we only dispatch the event with minimal parameters; the data is resolved later, hence asynchronous).\n\nIn my opinion,  this is a great way to declare async events because there’s the huge benefit of reusability. Should the data interface be changed in a future version of Magento, you can be sure that the async event (and your webhook integrations) will automatically receive them too! This is because we’re re-using the same data transfer objects as the web APIs. Not only that, but it works with any plugins added on them too!\n\n## **The Async Runtime**\n\nBy design, the core module does not define or dispatch any events. A separate package like [mageos-common-async-events](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-common-async-events) covers several standard events and dispatches them at the appropriate places. But dispatching an event is straightforward in itself.\n\n```\npublic function execute(Observer $observer): void\n\n{\n\n    /** @var Order $object */\n\n    $object = $observer->getEvent()->getData('order');\n\n    // arguments are the inputs required by the service class in the asynchronous\n\n    // event definition in async_events.xml\n\n    // e.g: Magento\\Sales\\Api\\OrderRepositoryInterface::get\n\n    $arguments = ['id' => $object->getId()];\n\n    $data = ['sales.order.created', $this->json->serialize($arguments)];\n\n    $this->publisher->publish(\n\n        QueueMetadataInterface::EVENT_QUEUE,\n\n        $data\n\n    );\n\n}\n```\n\nIt is not any different from publishing a message to a topic in Magento. The PublisherInterface takes in the event queue as the topic name and a serialised set of arguments that are needed to resolve the data later.\n\n## **Notifying Subscribers**\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\n![Example event-driven integrations from Mage-OS to various external platforms](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/async-events-1024x660.png)\n\n\u003Cfigcaption>\n\nExample event-driven integrations from Mage-OS to various external platforms\n\n\u003C/figcaption>\n\n\u003C/figure>\n\nEvents are delivered to the recipient by a concept called notifiers. They’re a topic for another day, but just remember that a notifier is responsible for sending it somewhere. It could support any protocol or application in theory. For example, HTTP, Amazon EventBridge, AMQP, Kafka, raw TCP or even just stdout if you want to simply stream it.\n\nA subscription comes in place to tie in the event to the destination. Subscriptions are created via the rest API provided by the module.\n\n```\ncurl --request POST 'https://dev.mageos.internal/rest/V1/async_event' \\\n\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN' \\\n\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n\n--data-raw '{\n\n    \"asyncEvent\": {\n\n        \"event_name\": \"sales.order.created\",\n\n        \"recipient_url\": \"https://example.com/order_created\",\n\n        \"verification_token\": \"sha-signing-secret\",\n\n        \"metadata\": \"http\"\n\n    }\n\n}'\n```\n\nThe metadata field is important. Here it describes that this subscription is http-based. Once this subscription is created, all sales.order.created in Magento will be sent to the recipent url specified in the subscription.\n\n```\ncurl --request POST 'https://dev.mageos.internal/rest/V1/async_event'' \\\n\n--data-raw '{\n\n    \"asyncEvent\": {\n\n        \"event_name\": \"sales.order.created\",\n\n        \"recipient_url\": \"arn:aws:events:ap-southeast-2:005158166381:rule/Test.EventBridge.Rule\",\n\n        \"verification_token\": \"sha-signing-secret\",\n\n        \"metadata\": \"amazon-eventbrige\"\n\n    }\n\n}'\n```\n\nHere’s another example to send the data to Amazon EventBrige. Once this subscription is created, the sales.order.created will flow to the HTTP endpoint and the Amazon Event Bus. Note that we did not have to do a deployment in order to send the data to another platform!\n\nWith that, we would have\n\n1. All `sales.order.created` events will be processed asynchronously without having a hiccup on your request thread, meaning it doesn’t affect users directly if one of those destinations is down or needs multiple retries.\n\n2. Failures and back pressure handling are taken care of by the framework. If one or both destinations are unreachable, the framework will appropriately schedule retries with backoff. If they’re still unreachable, we have an archive of events that we can replay in the future.\n\n3. All deliveries are logged and indexed in the admin panel, which we can query using the Lucene Query Syntax \\[3\\].\n\nThese are just the beginnings of what is possible with asynchronous events. The goal is to have wider adoption of async events just like regular events. If extension vendors and developers leverage the tools provided by the framework, it should develop into a very robust ecosystem that is standardised, functional and one that benefits everyone.\n\nI'm delighted that Async Events is a part of Mage-OS. I've enjoyed working on it and it has been fantastic to present it at a conference in Amsterdam and see all the support for it.\n\nNow of course, I had to put on my tourist hat for the next few days and explore every nook and cranny of this vibrant city, immersing myself in its culture, history, and hidden gems, leaving me with unforgettable memories.\n\n![Amsterdam](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/amsterdam-768x1024.jpg)\n\nThank you, and see you next time Amsterdam!\n\n---\n\n###### Learn More\n\nFind out more about Mage-OS's Async Events on GitHub:\n\n- [Base Module](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-async-events)\n\n- [Common Events](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-common-async-events)\n\n- [Admin UI](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-async-events-admin-ui)\n\n###### Get Involved\n\nIf you want to help contribute to Asnyc Events or anything else Mage-OS related then join our Discord server and one of our weekly meetings\n\n[Join Discord](http://chat.mage-os.org/)\n\n[Get Involved](/?page_id=331)\n\n###### References\n\n1.

The framework doesn’t provide any standard tooling. A module’s author is responsible for managing how that data is pulled out. It could be file-based, FTP, HTTP or with emails if you’d like to live on the edge.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Then there’s the murky problem of error handling. Anything that can go wrong will go wrong. The external system could be in a scheduled maintenance window, have an outage or even have network packets lost in transit. It is within the module to decide how failures should be handled. It could take the simple route of simply logging it to a custom log file, to a more sophisticated approach of having a retry job somewhere.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>They also need to be more flexible. If I wanted to send the same event to a second system, a third and a fourth, chances are I’ll have to modify the module each time and deploy the changes. If I want to send a different set of data but to an existing system(s), that’s again another deployment.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I would also be confident in saying that observability is the one thing that’s nearly impossible to achieve in integrations today. There simply isn’t a way to collect any sort of metrics to later pull up a dashboard and say “Ok, how many individual integrations have failed, where, when and why?” I believe we can do far better than looking through thousands of lines of error log files or emails to an error inbox saying something failed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It’s also far from ideal when we’re migrating between systems. For example, if we had customer platform A and we’re migrating to customer platform B, we’d likely have to install platform B’s module alongside platform A. Make them work together for a while, and then at some time in the future, disable and remove platform A’s module.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That’s already a fair few points that describe the subpar developer, operations and merchant experience.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We would like our integrations to be\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Fast and scalable, so we can have a high throughput stream of events enabling real-time systems like webhooks.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Fault-tolerant.

Meeting invitations will be sent to all members soon.\n\n## Marketing Updates\n\n- **Focus:** increase Magento brand awareness, countering competitors and debunking the myth that Magento is dead. We're launching a new campaign with consistent visuals and taglines to highlight the strength of Magento's community and ecosystem.\n\n- **Magento-opensource.com Project Progress:** \n  - The objective of magento-opensource.com is to provide merchants with information about the benefits of choosing Magento Open Source for their eCommerce website.\n  - It will complement Mage-OS.org, which is more technical and developer focused.\n  - This initiative is being led by Danny Verkade from the Magento Association, ensuring alignment with community goals to bring the Magento brand back to the market.\n  - The goal is to launch a MVP site by Meet Magento UK (June 18th, 2024) to highlight the platform's unmatched features, the advantages of open source, and Magento’s community and history.\n\n- **LinkedIn Campaign:** Our goal is to increase Magento's share of voice.

This Mage-OS update brings parity with Magento Open Source 2.4.7-p2, which was...",[18],"We are proud to announce Mage-OS Distribution version 1.0.4 is now available!\n\n## Release Notes\n\nThis Mage-OS update brings parity with Magento Open Source 2.4.7-p2, which was recently released with platform security fixes. When upgrading from an earlier version, please be sure to [rotate your encryption key](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-knowledge-base/kb/troubleshooting/known-issues-patches-attached/troubleshooting-encryption-key-rotation-cve-2024-34102?lang=en).\n\nPlease see the [release notes for Magento Open Source 2.4.7](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-operations/release/notes/magento-open-source/2-4-7) and the [patch notes for 2.4.7-p2](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-operations/release/notes/security-patches/2-4-7-patches).\n\nYou can get Mage-OS from our primary composer repository, [repo.mage-os.org](https://repo.mage-os.org).\n\n### What's Changed\n\n- Security changes from upstream 2.4.7-p2 by [@rhoerr](https://github.com/rhoerr) in [#101](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/pull/101)\n\n**Full Changelog**: [1.0.3...1.0.4](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/compare/1.0.3...1.0.4)\n\n### Mirror Updates\n\nThe latest Magento versions are also available from our public Magento mirror, [mirror.mage-os.org](https://mirror.mage-os.org):\n\n- 2.4.4-p10\n\n- 2.4.5-p9\n\n- 2.4.6-p7\n\n- 2.4.7-p2\n\nThis mirror composer repository is a drop-in replacement for Magento packages from repo.magento.com. This way you can install Magento without any login, using our public and repeatable build process from the official Magento sources.\n\n### Contributors\n\nThank you to Ryan Hoerr for managing this release, and to all that contributed to the Magento Open Source security reports and fixes.\n\nThank you also to all who attend our weekly tech meetings, and to all who have ongoing efforts underway!\n\n## Contribute\n\nAre you interested in contributing to Mage-OS, or have a bug or improvement you’d like to make? **We welcome pull requests** at [https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2)!\n\nIf you have a bigger project in mind, please [join Discord](http://chat.mage-os.org/) and summarize your idea. We’d be delighted to hear from you, and help figure out how your idea best fits into Mage-OS!\n\n## Installing Mage-OS\n\nYou can create a new Mage-OS project with the following SSH command:\n\n```\ncomposer create-project --repository-url=https://repo.mage-os.org/ mage-os/project-community-edition .\n```\n\nAfter a successful composer download, you will need to run the installer. Please see [DevDocs: Installation Guide for Mage-OS](https://devdocs.mage-os.org/docs/main)\n\n## Moving to Mage-OS\n\nIf you are already using Magento 2.4 and PHP 8.1+, you can change to Mage-OS by running the following in SSH:\n\n```\ncomposer config repositories.0 composer https://repo.mage-os.org/ && \\\n    composer require mage-os/product-community-edition --no-update && \\\n    composer remove magento/product-community-edition magento/composer-dependency-version-audit-plugin magento/composer-root-update-plugin --no-update && \\\n    composer remove sebastian/comparator --dev --no-update && \\\n    composer update --no-plugins --with-all-dependencies\n```\n\nWe strongly recommend updating to the latest Magento version (currently 2.4.7-p2) before changing to Mage-OS, to minimize issues.\n\nYour specific situation may require additional changes to your `composer.json` file. Generally this will involve changing `magento/` package names to `mage-os/`, or updating dependency versions.\n\n## What’s Next?\n\n### Our Vision for Mage-OS\n\nThe Mage-OS Distribution is an upstream compatible metapackage based on Magento Open Source. Think of it as an independent version of Magento—based on Magento source code, but including additional changes specific to Mage-OS.\n\nThe purpose of the Mage-OS core distribution is to provide\n\n- Improved decoupling of packages\n\n- Improved developer experience while working with the product\n\n- Improved developer experience while contributing to the product\n\n- Full compatibility with Magento extensions\n\n- Focus on additional security\n\n- Reduced infrastructure stack dependencies\n\n- Low-level code improvements, for example in the areas of caching and indexing\n\n- Removal of most bundled extensions contained in upstream (still independently installable if desired)\n\n- A simple documented migration path to Magento Open Source or Adobe Commerce\n\nMage-OS Distribution releases are made independently of upstream releases. This enables us to move faster when desired, for example when enabling compatibility with new PHP versions.\n\nNew functional features will be introduced through independently installable modules. This follows the same decoupling approach that Adobe Commerce is using, allowing for a more stable core and an independent feature module release schedule.\n\nThe goal of the reduced infrastructure stack dependencies is to enable new developers to be onboarded more easily. The goal is to be able to use a plain XAMPP stack on any machine, including Windows, to run and develop with Mage-OS. This requires making Elasticsearch optional, as well as ensuring services like Redis, RabbitMQ, Node.js and such remain optional.\n\nMage-OS will also maintain backwards compatibility and the ability to migrate upstream at multiple levels:\n\n- Compatibility with third-party extensions\n\n- Database level compatibility (data and schema)\n\n- API stability\n\nAll of our work on [creating custom releases based on Magento](https://github.com/mage-os/generate-mirror-repo-js) is open source, meaning:\n\n1.

Please see [DevDocs: Installation Guide for Mage-OS](https://devdocs.mage-os.org/docs/main)\n\n## Moving to Mage-OS\n\nIf you are already using Magento 2.4 and PHP 8.1+, you can change to Mage-OS by running the following in SSH:\n\n```\ncomposer config repositories.0 composer https://repo.mage-os.org/ && \\\n    composer require mage-os/product-community-edition --no-update && \\\n    composer remove magento/product-community-edition magento/composer-dependency-version-audit-plugin magento/composer-root-update-plugin --no-update && \\\n    composer remove sebastian/comparator --dev --no-update && \\\n    composer update --no-plugins --with-all-dependencies\n```\n\nWe strongly recommend updating to the latest Magento version (currently 2.4.7-p1) before changing to Mage-OS, to minimize issues.\n\nYour specific situation may require additional changes to your `composer.json` file. Generally this will involve changing `magento/` package names to `mage-os/`, or updating dependency versions.\n\n## What’s Next?\n\n### Our Vision for Mage-OS\n\nThe Mage-OS Distribution is an upstream compatible metapackage based on Magento Open Source. Think of it as an independent version of Magento—based on Magento source code, but including additional changes specific to Mage-OS.\n\nThe purpose of the Mage-OS core distribution is to provide\n\n- Improved decoupling of packages\n\n- Improved developer experience while working with the product\n\n- Improved developer experience while contributing to the product\n\n- Full compatibility with Magento extensions\n\n- Focus on additional security\n\n- Reduced infrastructure stack dependencies\n\n- Low-level code improvements, for example in the areas of caching and indexing\n\n- Removal of most bundled extensions contained in upstream (still independently installable if desired)\n\n- A simple documented migration path to Magento Open Source or Adobe Commerce\n\nMage-OS Distribution releases are made independently of upstream releases. This enables us to move faster when desired, for example when enabling compatibility with new PHP versions.\n\nNew functional features will be introduced through independently installable modules. This follows the same decoupling approach that Adobe Commerce is using, allowing for a more stable core and an independent feature module release schedule.\n\nThe goal of the reduced infrastructure stack dependencies is to enable new developers to be onboarded more easily. The goal is to be able to use a plain XAMPP stack on any machine, including Windows, to run and develop with Mage-OS. This requires making Elasticsearch optional, as well as ensuring services like Redis, RabbitMQ, Node.js and such remain optional.\n\nMage-OS will also maintain backwards compatibility and the ability to migrate upstream at multiple levels:\n\n- Compatibility with third-party extensions\n\n- Database level compatibility (data and schema)\n\n- API stability\n\nAll of our work on [creating custom releases based on Magento](https://github.com/mage-os/generate-mirror-repo-js) is open source, meaning:\n\n1.

This initiative is seen as a step forward in creating clarity around compatibility with Mage-OS. Members are encouraged to spread the word to ensure broader awareness and adoption.\n\nA **case studies directory** is in the works, aiming to centralize short-form studies categorized by verticals, business size, and region. Agencies could also link to their detailed studies, boosting visibility for their contributions.\n\nThe **Project Showcase Initiative** introduced metadata tags to highlight whether projects were built with Adobe Commerce, Magento, or Mage-OS. This change aims to showcase the ecosystem’s versatility and improve engagement, addressing the previous lackluster performance of the case study section.\n\n**Community engagement remains a priority.** Updates were shared on ongoing community-led initiatives, including admin theme development and compatibility enhancements with Magento Open Source. To encourage more contributions, efforts are being made to recognize and promote contributors more effectively.\n\nFrom a marketing perspective, the focus has been on **promoting Mage-OS and Magento through SEO-optimized content**, targeted campaigns, and case studies. The success of these efforts was evident at [Meet Magento Netherlands](https://nl.meet-magento.com/), which saw an impressive turnout of 450 attendees. Preparations are underway for upcoming events in Amsterdam, India, and Florida to share platform updates and engage the global community.\n\n## **Development Progress**\n\n### **Admin Theme Progress**\n\nThis month saw significant progress on the admin theme. Key features like attributes, ratings, and attribute sets were completed, with ongoing work focusing on system imports and tax rules under the Taxes section. The team also unveiled a new admin theme demo that received positive feedback, bringing the project closer to an alpha release. Improvements in usability and visual appeal remain a priority.\n\n### **Web Installer Advancements**\n\nThe [web installer](https://github.com/mage-os-lab/web-installer) is almost complete and ready for testing. Pending tasks include QA, security reviews, and documentation updates. Performance issues related to DI XML loading without caching were identified, and an interactive CLI installer is under development. These updates aim to streamline the installation process for users and improve overall performance.\n\n### **AI Tools Development**\n\nSeveral AI-powered tools made significant strides:\n\n- **AI Catalog Translation**: The module, supporting DeepL, OpenAI, and Gemini engines, is fully functional and awaiting publication on Packagist after additional QA.\n\n- **Backend Assistant**: A proof-of-concept for real-time assistance in the admin panel was presented, with deployment options being explored.\n\n- **AI Product Data Generation**: Version 3.1 is live, with feedback being collected to refine the tool further.\n\n### **Shared Page Builder Templates**\n\nWork began on features allowing the export and import of page builder templates, including all required CMS blocks. Development of an admin UI for this functionality is underway, with plans to publish the module on Packagist once stable. The initiative is part of a broader effort to simplify template management across sites.\n\n### **Security and Updates**\n\nThe team focused on improving responsiveness to security patches. Discussions centered on streamlining processes to address vulnerabilities more quickly. Additionally, [Mage-OS 1.0.5](/?p=4203) was released, achieving parity with Magento Open Source 2.4.7-p3 and addressing issues like search autocomplete and TinyMCE bugs.\n\n### **AI Models and Shared Configurations**\n\nDiscussions explored the potential for a unified configuration across AI modules, possibly using tools like LLPhant. While the idea was deferred for now, module-specific configurations will continue to evolve as more AI tools are adopted.\n\n### **Community Engagement and Contributions**\n\nEfforts to raise awareness about Mage-OS included plans for an ambassador program (WIP) and increased presence at events. The importance of contributions back to Magento Open Source is important, encouraging community members to share improvements while leaving the decision up to individual contributors.\n\n### **Branding and Compatibility Badge**\n\nSteps were taken to modernize Magento Open Source branding and align it with current standards. Work on the MageOS Compatibility Badge finished, with documentation and a dedicated [info page](/?page_id=4217) in development to provide clarity on compatibility standards.\n\nThis month showcased remarkable progress across development, AI initiatives, community building, and security, setting a strong foundation for the months ahead.\n\n## **Opportunities**\n\n- Want to help promote Magento and Mage-OS?

This release achieves full parity with Magento Open Source 2.4.7-p3, which incorporates...",[18],"We are excited to announce the release of Mage-OS Distribution 1.0.5!\n\n## Release Notes\n\nThis release achieves full parity with Magento Open Source 2.4.7-p3, which incorporates critical platform security enhancements.\n\nPlease check the [release notes for Magento Open Source 2.4.7](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-operations/release/notes/magento-open-source/2-4-7) and the [patch notes for 2.4.7-p3](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-operations/release/notes/security-patches/2-4-7-patches).\n\nYou can get Mage-OS from our primary composer repository, [repo.mage-os.org](https://repo.mage-os.org).\n\n### What's Changed\n\n- [Mage-OS 1.0.5 is based on Magento 2.4.7-p3](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/pull/107) by [rhoerr](https://github.com/rhoerr)\n\n- [Changed TinyMCE 7 to 6 for license compatibility](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/pull/107) by [fballiano](https://github.com/fballiano)\n\n- [Improved menu/toolbar settings for TinyMCE 6](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/pull/109) by [rhoerr](https://github.com/rhoerr)\n\n- [Disabled javascript minifying of TinyMCE, fixing a bug loading language files](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/pull/107) by [hostep](https://github.com/hostep)\n\n- [Restored compatibility with TinyMCE plugins, after upgrading from v5](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/pull/107) by [hostep](https://github.com/hostep)\n\n- [Fixed a bug with autocomplete suggesting non-searchable terms](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/pull/110) by [kuafucode](https://github.com/kuafucode)\n\n**Full Changelog**: [1.0.4...1.0.5](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/compare/1.0.4...1.0.5)\n\n### Mirror Updates\n\nThe latest Magento versions are also available from our public Magento mirror, [mirror.mage-os.org](https://mirror.mage-os.org):\n\n- 2.4.4-p11\n\n- 2.4.5-p10\n\n- 2.4.6-p8\n\n- 2.4.7-p3\n\nThis mirror composer repository is a drop-in replacement for Magento packages from repo.magento.com. This way you can install Magento without any login, using our public and repeatable build process from the official Magento sources.\n\n## Contribute\n\nAre you interested in contributing to Mage-OS, or have a bug or improvement you’d like to make? **We welcome pull requests** at [https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2)!\n\nIf you have a bigger project in mind, please [join Discord](http://chat.mage-os.org/) and summarize your idea. We’d be delighted to hear from you, and help figure out how your idea best fits into Mage-OS!\n\n## Installing Mage-OS\n\nYou can create a new Mage-OS project with the following SSH command:\n\n```\ncomposer create-project --repository-url=https://repo.mage-os.org/ mage-os/project-community-edition .\n```\n\nAfter a successful composer download, you will need to run the installer. Please see [DevDocs: Installation Guide for Mage-OS](https://devdocs.mage-os.org/docs/main)\n\n## Moving to Mage-OS\n\nIf you are already using Magento 2.4 and PHP 8.1+, you can change to Mage-OS by running the following in SSH:\n\n```\ncomposer config repositories.0 composer https://repo.mage-os.org/ &&\n    composer require mage-os/product-community-edition --no-update &&\n    composer remove magento/product-community-edition magento/composer-dependency-version-audit-plugin magento/composer-root-update-plugin --no-update &&\n    composer remove sebastian/comparator --dev --no-update &&\n    composer update --no-plugins --with-all-dependencies\n```\n\nWe strongly recommend updating to the latest Magento version (currently 2.4.7-p2) before changing to Mage-OS, to minimize issues.\n\nYour specific situation may require additional changes to your `composer.json` file. Generally this will involve changing `magento/` package names to `mage-os/`, or updating dependency versions.\n\n## What’s Next?\n\n### Our Vision for Mage-OS\n\nThe Mage-OS Distribution is an upstream compatible metapackage based on Magento Open Source. Think of it as an independent version of Magento—based on Magento source code, but including additional changes specific to Mage-OS.\n\nThe purpose of the Mage-OS core distribution is to provide\n\n- Improved decoupling of packages\n\n- Improved developer experience while working with the product\n\n- Improved developer experience while contributing to the product\n\n- Full compatibility with Magento extensions\n\n- Focus on additional security\n\n- Reduced infrastructure stack dependencies\n\n- Low-level code improvements, for example in the areas of caching and indexing\n\n- Removal of most bundled extensions contained in upstream (still independently installable if desired)\n\n- A simple documented migration path to Magento Open Source or Adobe Commerce\n\nMage-OS Distribution releases are made independently of upstream releases. This enables us to move faster when desired, for example when enabling compatibility with new PHP versions.\n\nNew functional features will be introduced through independently installable modules. This follows the same decoupling approach that Adobe Commerce is using, allowing for a more stable core and an independent feature module release schedule.\n\nThe goal of the reduced infrastructure stack dependencies is to enable new developers to be onboarded more easily. The goal is to be able to use a plain XAMPP stack on any machine, including Windows, to run and develop with Mage-OS. This requires making Elasticsearch optional, as well as ensuring services like Redis, RabbitMQ, Node.js and such remain optional.\n\nMage-OS will also maintain backwards compatibility and the ability to migrate upstream at multiple levels:\n\n- Compatibility with third-party extensions\n\n- Database level compatibility (data and schema)\n\n- API stability\n\nAll of our work on [creating custom releases based on Magento](https://github.com/mage-os/generate-mirror-repo-js) is open source, meaning:\n\n1. Mage-OS builds can be independently built and verified, and are fully reproducible;\n\n2. If you want to create your own fork and version of Magento or Mage-OS, you can do that too.\n\nThat’s all for now!","src/data/post/2024-11-06-release-mage-os-distribution-1-0-5.md","bd4f45f31c7f06b7",{"html":2153,"metadata":2154},"\u003Cp>We are excited to announce the release of Mage-OS Distribution 1.0.5!\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"release-notes\">Release Notes\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>This release achieves full parity with Magento Open Source 2.4.7-p3, which incorporates critical platform security enhancements.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Please check the \u003Ca href=\"https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-operations/release/notes/magento-open-source/2-4-7\">release notes for Magento Open Source 2.4.7\u003C/a> and the \u003Ca href=\"https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-operations/release/notes/security-patches/2-4-7-patches\">patch notes for 2.4.7-p3\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You can get Mage-OS from our primary composer repository, \u003Ca href=\"https://repo.mage-os.org\">repo.mage-os.org\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"whats-changed\">What’s Changed\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/pull/107\">Mage-OS 1.0.5 is based on Magento 2.4.7-p3\u003C/a> by \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/rhoerr\">rhoerr\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/pull/107\">Changed TinyMCE 7 to 6 for license compatibility\u003C/a> by \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/fballiano\">fballiano\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/pull/109\">Improved menu/toolbar settings for TinyMCE 6\u003C/a> by \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/rhoerr\">rhoerr\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/pull/107\">Disabled javascript minifying of TinyMCE, fixing a bug loading language files\u003C/a> by \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/hostep\">hostep\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/pull/107\">Restored compatibility with TinyMCE plugins, after upgrading from v5\u003C/a> by \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/hostep\">hostep\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/pull/110\">Fixed a bug with autocomplete suggesting non-searchable terms\u003C/a> by \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/kuafucode\">kuafucode\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Full Changelog\u003C/strong>: \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/compare/1.0.4...1.0.5\">1.0.4…1.0.5\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"mirror-updates\">Mirror Updates\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The latest Magento versions are also available from our public Magento mirror, \u003Ca href=\"https://mirror.mage-os.org\">mirror.mage-os.org\u003C/a>:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>2.4.4-p11\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>2.4.5-p10\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>2.4.6-p8\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>2.4.7-p3\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>This mirror composer repository is a drop-in replacement for Magento packages from repo.magento.com.

As 2024 wraps up, we want to take a moment to celebrate everything we’ve accomplished together...","**Looking Back on an Awesome Year with Mage-OS – Happy New Year!**\n\nAs 2024 wraps up, we want to take a moment to celebrate everything we’ve accomplished together and thank the amazing Mage-OS and Magento communities who made it all happen. This year has been incredible, full of progress, teamwork, and creative ideas.\n\n### Highlights from the Year\n\n**January - March:** We started the year strong, kicking off exciting projects and sparking conversations about Magento’s future. Some big moments included the Mage-OS async events and Gowri’s inspiring journey with asynchronous systems. February’s Mage-OS Nederland member meeting was another highlight, showing how global our community truly is.\n\n**April - June:** Spring kept the momentum going! In April, we celebrated new contributions and shared exciting plans for the platform. By June, we saw awesome progress in tools and community engagement, cementing Mage-OS as a space for fresh ideas and growth. We also had our first hire!\n\n**July - September:** Summer was packed with activity, including community events like the Magento meetups across North America and Europe. These gatherings brought us closer together and sparked creative solutions for the future. This September defined our community, showcasing just how much we can achieve when we work together.\n\n**October - December:** The final months of the year were full of energy and achievements. November’s release of Mage-OS Distribution 1.0.5 was a new milestone, reflecting the incredible effort and expertise of contributors worldwide. The behind-the-scenes stories from September's and November’s events gave us a glimpse into the exciting possibilities ahead. The tech channel also became a lively hub, buzzing with ideas and collaboration. We were happy to welcome Fabrizio to the team, whose fresh perspective and innovative ideas have already made a big impact. We had our first retro and identified some exciting changes ahead to help improve our processes. The Italian community and events were set up and we're excited to see the new activity and ideas!\n\n**Reclaiming the Magento Brand**\n\nTogether with the [Magento Association](http://magentoassociation.org), we achieved something truly historic this year: we bought back the Magento brand. This is a massive achievement for our community and a testament to what we can accomplish together. To celebrate and raise awareness about Magento, we ran an extensive campaign across social media, with many LinkedIn posts showcasing the vibrant, dedicated community.

Two exciting additions...","Initiatives",[18],"E-commerce is constantly changing, and Magento continues to be a leading platform, providing great tools for developers and businesses. Two exciting additions to this system have recently stood out: the Automatic Translations Module and the PageBuilder Import-Export Module. Created by [Davide Lunardon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davide-lunardon-b78813a1/), [Luca Fuser](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luca-alessio-fuser/) and [Samuele Martini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuele-martini-02820795/), these tools aim to make Magento even more useful and easy to use.\n\n## **The Automatic Translations Module**\n\n### **How It Was Developed**\n\nDuring the Covid period, [Samuele Martini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuele-martini-02820795/) began exploring generative AI technologies, particularly OpenAI, with the goal of innovating within e-commerce. An old challenge resurfaced: years ago, a client requested automatic product description generation during ERP imports, which was not feasible at the time.\n\nFast-forward to a new client of Davide Lunardon, who needed to expand into the French market but lacked translated product data. Given high translation costs and the prospect of further expansions, Samuele and Davide revisited the AI-based module concept, integrating it with DeepL, OpenAI, and Google Gemini to create high-quality translations at a fraction of the cost. The result was an efficient, scalable translation module for Magento. \n\nThe module enables the translation of all entities, including products, categories, CMS pages, and static blocks, into almost any language. For the product catalog, it offers two modes: a manual option, accessible via a button in the admin panel, and an automatic mode using cron jobs. The automatic mode includes configurable control systems to prevent the retranslation of manually modified products while allowing forced retranslation if descriptions in the primary language change. Categories, CMS pages, and static blocks, however, can only be translated manually via the admin panel button. Given the module's effectiveness, we decided to make it available to communities through Mage-OS.\n\n### **Challenges in Development**\n\n1. **Handling HTML in Descriptions** – Ensuring AI engines preserved structural elements while translating text was complex.\n\n2. **Prompt Engineering** – While DeepL required no prompts, OpenAI and Gemini needed specific instructions to produce quality translations.\n\n3. **Attribute Translation** – Unlike textual attributes, select and multiselect attributes store only IDs, requiring a separate translation mechanism.\n\n4. **Alt Text Handling** – Since Magento associates alt text with a \"gallery\" entity, special logic was needed to integrate it seamlessly.\n\nToday, [the module](https://github.com/mage-os-lab/module-automatic-translation) allows merchants to translate products, categories, CMS pages, and static blocks either manually or automatically via cron jobs, ensuring efficient multilingual expansion. Recognizing its potential, Samuele and Davide made it available to the Mage-OS community.\n\n## **PageBuilder Import-Export Module**\n\n### **How It Was Developed**\n\nMagento’s PageBuilder is widely used for content management, but one major limitation has always been the inability to export and import CMS pages and blocks between environments. Recognizing this issue, Davide Lunardon proposed an extension to enable seamless content transfers. \n\nThe module allows users to export templates as zip files containing:\n\n- **template.html** (HTML content)\n\n- **preview.jpg** (visual representation)\n\n- **config.xml** (metadata configuration)\n\n- **Children folder** (nested CMS blocks)\n\n- **Asset folder** (related images)\n\nAdditionally, a Dropbox API integration enables remote template imports. This innovation means merchants can now version and distribute CMS content efficiently across sites.\n\n### **Challenges in Development**\n\n1. **Recursive CMS Dependency Handling** – Extracting interdependent assets and templates in a structured manner was a significant challenge.\n\n2. **Choosing the Right Remote Service** – A flexible API solution was needed for sustainable integration with Mage-OS.\n\nSupported by fellow developers Luca Fuser and Samuele Martini, Davide’s vision took shape, and [the module](https://github.com/mage-os-lab/module-pagebuilder-template-import-export) is now actively being refined for stability and efficiency.\n\nThe module was created by [**Samuele Martini**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuele-martini-02820795/) and [**Davide Lunardon**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davide-lunardon-b78813a1/), two experienced developers with a strong background in e-commerce solutions.\n\n## **About the Developers**\n\n![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AD_4nXc3l9wjH95o8Nah8a5dR7ZF33NlgfoJroZN-7IrOxBdipcTs5RsIAt2LU5hdqHN0RJAmZQpvMIVxHrtbmxKXrvWlWwxU9Joo-QItqsE0ErUKsSFflay3kNx_PECYOIICAAJH-ch.png)\n\nSamuele, a developer from Treviso, Italy, has a diverse academic background in statistics, business management, and computer science. After earning his degree from the University of Padua in 2011, he built his career across multiple web agencies, progressing from developer to technical director. In 2025, he decided to start his own business, collaborating with Davide, a longtime friend and former colleague.\n\nDavide is a passionate web developer and an amateur table tennis player. Since becoming a freelancer in late 2020, he has primarily worked with companies and agencies in Italy, bringing his expertise in web development to various projects. Together, Samuele and Davide combined their skills to develop this module, aiming to make translation in e-commerce more efficient and accessible.\n\n### **How They Discovered Magento**\n\nSamuele and Davide’s journey with Magento began at different times, but for similar reasons – its flexibility and power as an e-commerce platform.\n\nDavide first encountered Magento in 2016 while working on projects for one of the companies he was employed at. It was instant love, especially with Magento 1, as Magento 2 was not yet fully stable at the time. The platform’s capabilities and potential drew him in, sparking his deep interest in e-commerce development.\n\nFor Samuele, the transition to Magento came as a strategic decision. Initially working on corporate websites with WordPress, he witnessed the agency he worked for pivot toward e-commerce due to the industry's rapid growth. During their research, they evaluated multiple platforms, including Prestashop, Shopware, and Magento. After a detailed analysis, Samuele recommended Magento because it functioned more like a framework than a traditional CMS, making it ideal for custom, scalable developments. This adaptability made it the perfect choice for handling complex, tailored e-commerce projects.\n\nTheir shared passion for Magento eventually led them to specialize in the platform, laying the foundation for their later collaboration and the development of their module.\n\n### **What They Love About Magento**\n\nBoth Samuele and Davide appreciate Magento for its robustness, flexibility, and developer-friendly architecture, which makes it a powerful tool for building and maintaining e-commerce platforms.\n\nFor Samuele, Magento’s greatest strength is its comprehensiveness. Unlike other platforms that are still catching up on essential features like wishlists and bundled products, Magento has offered these since 2007. From a developer’s perspective, Magento provides an innovative yet intuitive set of patterns that make extending functionality seamless. Features like preferences, plugins, viewModels, virtual types, argument preferences, and dependency injection are unique tools not commonly found in other PHP frameworks, making Magento an extremely versatile and customizable platform.\n\nDavide values Magento’s elasticity and the structured framework that enables scalability and maintainability when managed correctly. The dependency injection system, virtual types, and plugin architecture give developers unparalleled control over customizations. Additionally, its open-source nature allows for deep, ad-hoc integrations tailored to specific business needs. He also highlights the out-of-the-box features that have been present since Magento 1 and continue in Magento 2, making it a large, stable, and complete codebase for e-commerce development. For Davide, working on complex e-commerce projects without Magento would be unimaginable.\n\n### **Their Relationship with Mage-OS**\n\nMage-OS provides an independent, community-driven environment for Magento development. It ensures that Magento remains open-source and continues evolving with valuable features. Through their contributions, Davide and Samuele have enhanced Magento’s capabilities, making it more accessible and powerful for businesses worldwide. Both Samuele and Davide see Mage-OS as a crucial initiative for preserving and expanding Magento’s open-source ecosystem, allowing them to contribute to the platform in ways that weren’t possible before.\n\nSamuele first learned about Mage-OS through [Alessandro Ronchi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandroronchi/) and was immediately drawn to its clear objectives. He sees its role as twofold: first, ensuring that Magento remains open source, no matter what; and second, enhancing Magento’s core functionality, rather than just integrating Adobe SaaS services. Samuele has actively contributed by working on an AI-powered automatic translation suite alongside Davide, and participating in the OpenAI integration module developed by [Ryan Sun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanyinsun/).\n\nFor Davide, Mage-OS represents freedom – the ability to contribute to Magento without restrictions imposed by corporate ownership. While he acknowledges Adobe’s contributions, he feels that Magento has changed significantly since the acquisition.

Two exciting additions to this system have recently stood out: the Automatic Translations Module and the PageBuilder Import-Export Module. Created by \u003Ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davide-lunardon-b78813a1/\">Davide Lunardon\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/luca-alessio-fuser/\">Luca Fuser\u003C/a> and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuele-martini-02820795/\">Samuele Martini\u003C/a>, these tools aim to make Magento even more useful and easy to use.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"the-automatic-translations-module\">\u003Cstrong>The Automatic Translations Module\u003C/strong>\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"how-it-was-developed\">\u003Cstrong>How It Was Developed\u003C/strong>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>During the Covid period, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuele-martini-02820795/\">Samuele Martini\u003C/a> began exploring generative AI technologies, particularly OpenAI, with the goal of innovating within e-commerce. An old challenge resurfaced: years ago, a client requested automatic product description generation during ERP imports, which was not feasible at the time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Fast-forward to a new client of Davide Lunardon, who needed to expand into the French market but lacked translated product data. Given high translation costs and the prospect of further expansions, Samuele and Davide revisited the AI-based module concept, integrating it with DeepL, OpenAI, and Google Gemini to create high-quality translations at a fraction of the cost. The result was an efficient, scalable translation module for Magento. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The module enables the translation of all entities, including products, categories, CMS pages, and static blocks, into almost any language. For the product catalog, it offers two modes: a manual option, accessible via a button in the admin panel, and an automatic mode using cron jobs. The automatic mode includes configurable control systems to prevent the retranslation of manually modified products while allowing forced retranslation if descriptions in the primary language change. Categories, CMS pages, and static blocks, however, can only be translated manually via the admin panel button. Given the module’s effectiveness, we decided to make it available to communities through Mage-OS.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"challenges-in-development\">\u003Cstrong>Challenges in Development\u003C/strong>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Handling HTML in Descriptions\u003C/strong> – Ensuring AI engines preserved structural elements while translating text was complex.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Prompt Engineering\u003C/strong> – While DeepL required no prompts, OpenAI and Gemini needed specific instructions to produce quality translations.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Attribute Translation\u003C/strong> – Unlike textual attributes, select and multiselect attributes store only IDs, requiring a separate translation mechanism.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Alt Text Handling\u003C/strong> – Since Magento associates alt text with a “gallery” entity, special logic was needed to integrate it seamlessly.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Cp>Today, \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/mage-os-lab/module-automatic-translation\">the module\u003C/a> allows merchants to translate products, categories, CMS pages, and static blocks either manually or automatically via cron jobs, ensuring efficient multilingual expansion.

After earning his degree from the University of Padua in 2011, he built his career across multiple web agencies, progressing from developer to technical director. In 2025, he decided to start his own business, collaborating with Davide, a longtime friend and former colleague.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Davide is a passionate web developer and an amateur table tennis player. Since becoming a freelancer in late 2020, he has primarily worked with companies and agencies in Italy, bringing his expertise in web development to various projects. Together, Samuele and Davide combined their skills to develop this module, aiming to make translation in e-commerce more efficient and accessible.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"how-they-discovered-magento\">\u003Cstrong>How They Discovered Magento\u003C/strong>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Samuele and Davide’s journey with Magento began at different times, but for similar reasons – its flexibility and power as an e-commerce platform.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Davide first encountered Magento in 2016 while working on projects for one of the companies he was employed at. It was instant love, especially with Magento 1, as Magento 2 was not yet fully stable at the time. The platform’s capabilities and potential drew him in, sparking his deep interest in e-commerce development.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For Samuele, the transition to Magento came as a strategic decision. Initially working on corporate websites with WordPress, he witnessed the agency he worked for pivot toward e-commerce due to the industry’s rapid growth. During their research, they evaluated multiple platforms, including Prestashop, Shopware, and Magento. After a detailed analysis, Samuele recommended Magento because it functioned more like a framework than a traditional CMS, making it ideal for custom, scalable developments. This adaptability made it the perfect choice for handling complex, tailored e-commerce projects.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Their shared passion for Magento eventually led them to specialize in the platform, laying the foundation for their later collaboration and the development of their module.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"what-they-love-about-magento\">\u003Cstrong>What They Love About Magento\u003C/strong>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Both Samuele and Davide appreciate Magento for its robustness, flexibility, and developer-friendly architecture, which makes it a powerful tool for building and maintaining e-commerce platforms.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For Samuele, Magento’s greatest strength is its comprehensiveness. Unlike other platforms that are still catching up on essential features like wishlists and bundled products, Magento has offered these since 2007. From a developer’s perspective, Magento provides an innovative yet intuitive set of patterns that make extending functionality seamless. Features like preferences, plugins, viewModels, virtual types, argument preferences, and dependency injection are unique tools not commonly found in other PHP frameworks, making Magento an extremely versatile and customizable platform.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Davide values Magento’s elasticity and the structured framework that enables scalability and maintainability when managed correctly. The dependency injection system, virtual types, and plugin architecture give developers unparalleled control over customizations. Additionally, its open-source nature allows for deep, ad-hoc integrations tailored to specific business needs. He also highlights the out-of-the-box features that have been present since Magento 1 and continue in Magento 2, making it a large, stable, and complete codebase for e-commerce development. For Davide, working on complex e-commerce projects without Magento would be unimaginable.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"their-relationship-with-mage-os\">\u003Cstrong>Their Relationship with Mage-OS\u003C/strong>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Mage-OS provides an independent, community-driven environment for Magento development. It ensures that Magento remains open-source and continues evolving with valuable features. Through their contributions, Davide and Samuele have enhanced Magento’s capabilities, making it more accessible and powerful for businesses worldwide. Both Samuele and Davide see Mage-OS as a crucial initiative for preserving and expanding Magento’s open-source ecosystem, allowing them to contribute to the platform in ways that weren’t possible before.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Samuele first learned about Mage-OS through \u003Ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandroronchi/\">Alessandro Ronchi\u003C/a> and was immediately drawn to its clear objectives. He sees its role as twofold: first, ensuring that Magento remains open source, no matter what; and second, enhancing Magento’s core functionality, rather than just integrating Adobe SaaS services. Samuele has actively contributed by working on an AI-powered automatic translation suite alongside Davide, and participating in the OpenAI integration module developed by \u003Ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanyinsun/\">Ryan Sun\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For Davide, Mage-OS represents freedom – the ability to contribute to Magento without restrictions imposed by corporate ownership. While he acknowledges Adobe’s contributions, he feels that Magento has changed significantly since the acquisition. With Mage-OS, he can now develop and release tools that directly benefit the Magento ecosystem, something he couldn’t do while working within agencies. Seeing how much Magento has shaped his career, he is eager to give back to the community and help restore Magento’s reputation and strength through Mage-OS.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>With the Automatic Translations Module and PageBuilder Import-Export Module, Magento developers and merchants can now work more efficiently, scale into new markets, and manage content seamlessly.

This release achieves full parity with Magento Open Source 2.4.7-p4, which incorporates...",[18],"We are excited to announce the release of Mage-OS Distribution 1.0.6!\n\n## Release Notes\n\nThis release achieves full parity with Magento Open Source 2.4.7-p4, which incorporates critical platform security enhancements.\n\nPlease check the [release notes for Magento Open Source 2.4.7](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-operations/release/notes/magento-open-source/2-4-7) and the [patch notes for 2.4.7-p4](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-operations/release/notes/security-patches/2-4-7-patches).\n\nYou can get Mage-OS from our primary composer repository, [repo.mage-os.org](https://repo.mage-os.org).\n\n### What's Changed\n\n- [Mage-OS 1.0.6 is based on Magento 2.4.7-p4](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/pull/121) by [@rhoerr](https://github.com/rhoerr)\n\n- [Split Magento and Mage-OS versions in ProductMetadata for compatibility](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/pull/115) by [@rhoerr](https://github.com/rhoerr)\n\n- [Fixed a bug when setting number of address line lower breaks checkout](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/pull/117) by [@ProxiBlue](https://github.com/ProxiBlue)\n\n- [Added Sansec eComscan Security Scan Workflow](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/pull/112) by [@fballiano](https://github.com/fballiano)\n\n**Full Changelog**: [1.0.5...1.0.6](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/compare/1.0.5...1.0.6)\n\nThanks to everyone that helped with this release! Including: Fabrizio Balliano, Ryan Hoerr, Vinai Kopp, Lucas van Staden, Francis Gallagher, Tu Van, Peter Jaap Blaakmeer.\n\n### Mirror Updates\n\nThe latest Magento versions are also available from our public Magento mirror, [mirror.mage-os.org](https://mirror.mage-os.org):\n\n- 2.4.4-p12\n\n- 2.4.5-p11\n\n- 2.4.6-p9\n\n- 2.4.7-p4\n\nThis mirror composer repository is a drop-in replacement for Magento packages from repo.magento.com. This way you can install Magento without any login, using our public and repeatable build process from the official Magento sources.\n\n## Contribute\n\nAre you interested in contributing to Mage-OS, or have a bug or improvement you’d like to make? **We welcome pull requests** at [https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2)!\n\nIf you have a bigger project in mind, please [join Discord](http://chat.mage-os.org/) and summarize your idea. We’d be delighted to hear from you, and help figure out how your idea best fits into Mage-OS!\n\n## Installing Mage-OS\n\nYou can create a new Mage-OS project with the following SSH command:\n\n```\ncomposer create-project --repository-url=https://repo.mage-os.org/ mage-os/project-community-edition .\n```\n\nAfter a successful composer download, you will need to run the installer. Please see [DevDocs: Installation Guide for Mage-OS](https://devdocs.mage-os.org/docs/main)\n\n## Moving to Mage-OS\n\nIf you are already using Magento 2.4 and PHP 8.1+, you can change to Mage-OS by running the following in SSH:\n\n```\ncomposer config repositories.0 composer https://repo.mage-os.org/ &&\n    composer require mage-os/product-community-edition --no-update &&\n    composer remove magento/product-community-edition magento/composer-dependency-version-audit-plugin magento/composer-root-update-plugin --no-update &&\n    composer remove sebastian/comparator --dev --no-update &&\n    composer update --no-plugins --with-all-dependencies\n```\n\nWe strongly recommend updating to the latest Magento version (currently 2.4.7-p2) before changing to Mage-OS, to minimize issues.\n\nYour specific situation may require additional changes to your `composer.json` file. Generally this will involve changing `magento/` package names to `mage-os/`, or updating dependency versions.\n\n## What’s Next?\n\n### Our Vision for Mage-OS\n\nThe Mage-OS Distribution is an upstream compatible metapackage based on Magento Open Source. Think of it as an independent version of Magento—based on Magento source code, but including additional changes specific to Mage-OS.\n\nThe purpose of the Mage-OS core distribution is to provide\n\n- Improved decoupling of packages\n\n- Improved developer experience while working with the product\n\n- Improved developer experience while contributing to the product\n\n- Full compatibility with Magento extensions\n\n- Focus on additional security\n\n- Reduced infrastructure stack dependencies\n\n- Low-level code improvements, for example in the areas of caching and indexing\n\n- Removal of most bundled extensions contained in upstream (still independently installable if desired)\n\n- A simple documented migration path to Magento Open Source or Adobe Commerce\n\nMage-OS Distribution releases are made independently of upstream releases. This enables us to move faster when desired, for example when enabling compatibility with new PHP versions.\n\nNew functional features will be introduced through independently installable modules. This follows the same decoupling approach that Adobe Commerce is using, allowing for a more stable core and an independent feature module release schedule.\n\nThe goal of the reduced infrastructure stack dependencies is to enable new developers to be onboarded more easily. The goal is to be able to use a plain XAMPP stack on any machine, including Windows, to run and develop with Mage-OS. This requires making Elasticsearch optional, as well as ensuring services like Redis, RabbitMQ, Node.js and such remain optional.\n\nMage-OS will also maintain backwards compatibility and the ability to migrate upstream at multiple levels:\n\n- Compatibility with third-party extensions\n\n- Database level compatibility (data and schema)\n\n- API stability\n\nAll of our work on [creating custom releases based on Magento](https://github.com/mage-os/generate-mirror-repo-js) is open source, meaning:\n\n1. Mage-OS builds can be independently built and verified, and are fully reproducible;\n\n2. If you want to create your own fork and version of Magento or Mage-OS, you can do that too.\n\nThat’s all for now!","src/data/post/2025-02-13-release-mage-os-distribution-1-0-6.md","5e54ee1750727a0b",{"html":2282,"metadata":2283},"\u003Cp>We are excited to announce the release of Mage-OS Distribution 1.0.6!\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"release-notes\">Release Notes\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>This release achieves full parity with Magento Open Source 2.4.7-p4, which incorporates critical platform security enhancements.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Please check the \u003Ca href=\"https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-operations/release/notes/magento-open-source/2-4-7\">release notes for Magento Open Source 2.4.7\u003C/a> and the \u003Ca href=\"https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-operations/release/notes/security-patches/2-4-7-patches\">patch notes for 2.4.7-p4\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You can get Mage-OS from our primary composer repository, \u003Ca href=\"https://repo.mage-os.org\">repo.mage-os.org\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"whats-changed\">What’s Changed\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/pull/121\">Mage-OS 1.0.6 is based on Magento 2.4.7-p4\u003C/a> by \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/rhoerr\">@rhoerr\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/pull/115\">Split Magento and Mage-OS versions in ProductMetadata for compatibility\u003C/a> by \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/rhoerr\">@rhoerr\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/pull/117\">Fixed a bug when setting number of address line lower breaks checkout\u003C/a> by \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/ProxiBlue\">@ProxiBlue\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/pull/112\">Added Sansec eComscan Security Scan Workflow\u003C/a> by \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/fballiano\">@fballiano\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Full Changelog\u003C/strong>: \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2/compare/1.0.5...1.0.6\">1.0.5…1.0.6\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thanks to everyone that helped with this release!

Held on March 25 at the Étoile Business Center in Paris, the inaugural event gathered over 350 participants from across Europe, including merchants, developers, agencies, and technology partners. For [Thien-Lan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thienlan/), participating in Meet Magento France 2025 was especially meaningful, as it brought the Magento community together in her hometown—a place where she was born, raised, and began her professional journey.\n\nThe sold-out edition radiated energy, innovation, and community spirit. From visionary keynotes by leaders to technical deep-dives and strategic sessions, attendees were treated to a day rich in insights and inspiration. Beyond the talks, the event celebrated its open-source DNA with strong representation from [Magento Open Source](https://magento-opensource.com/), Adobe Commerce, Mage-OS and many more offering something for everyone. The organizers—led by Camille Bénard and supported by an all-star team—created a vibrant, unforgettable experience, topped off with lively networking, a cocktail party, and even an afterparty for the night owls. This first-ever Meet Magento France didn’t just meet expectations—it set a new standard for community-driven events in the ecosystem.\n\nCheck out the [official LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/meet-magento-france_magento-ecommerce-adobecommerce-activity-7310367386577088512-jYNS/?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAABUaYtIBKBOe9-aESwhKh4_njhnvo98UZxQ) for Meet Magento France for updates, highlights, and community insights!\n\n[![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1742923840841-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/meet-magento-france_magento-ecommerce-adobecommerce-activity-7310367386577088512-jYNS?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAABUaYtIBKBOe9-aESwhKh4_njhnvo98UZxQ)\n\n### Tech Updates\n\nWe started strong:\n\n- **Terraform to OpenTofu** migration wrapped up smoothly.\n\n- **Reservations Grid** got a facelift thanks to [David Tabatadze](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-tabatadze-981055213/) (who powered through even while recovering from surgery—hero move ).\n\n- **New Admin Theme** is nearly done. Artem squashed the bugs and made it 1.1-ready.\n\nAnd in the background, **AI tools** kept getting sharper. The backend assistant now runs on multiple models, executes SQL, and is waiting for its own Lab repo.\n\n### GitHub Drama\n\nMid-month, everything vanished—**Mage-OS GitHub orgs were flagged**. No access. No explanation. Just... 404s.\n\nThe community rallied: backups were made, mirrors tested, GitHub tickets opened.  \nEventually, the orgs were cleared. It was a spam false-positive. No apology, but we’re back online and stronger for it. (Also, shoutout to everyone who kept cool during the blackout) It was a wake-up call about how much we rely on third-party services. We're now actively exploring backup strategies and alternative plans to be better prepared if something like this happens again.\n\n##### CMS, SEO, and Smarter Widgets\n\n[Davide Lunardon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davide-lunardon-b78813a1/) explored integrating **GrapesJS**, but pivoted after discovering Magento CMS widgets are trickier than they look. Now, he's building a more powerful \"CMS Widget\" component instead—with previews and repeatable fields.\n\nMeanwhile, [Samuele](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuele-martini-02820795/) dropped a module for **meta robots control** (think: noindex, nofollow)—now ready for testing.\n\n##### Prepping for Mage-OS 1.1\n\nThe big 1.1 release is brewing. We’re syncing with Magento 2.4.8 and lining up features:\n\n- New Admin Theme\n\n- Optional Creatuity interceptor module\n\n- Possibly even a revamped web installer  \n   Testing and merges are ramping up in April.\n\n## **Opportunities**\n\n- Want to help promote Magento and Mage-OS?

Learn more [here](https://mage-os.org/updates/m137-admin-theme/).\n\nVersion 1.1.1 was released shortly after to fix a bug in configurable products and make small adjustments to the admin theme. Additional user experience enhancements, including message layout and accessibility improvements, are planned for future updates.\n\nThe new admin theme is being widely adopted, with over 200 Figma design uses and growing engagement on GitHub. It is likely to become the default in upcoming releases.\n\n---\n\n### Module Management and Namespace Strategy\n\nThere is ongoing discussion about how and when modules from the `mageos-lab` namespace should graduate to the official `mageos` namespace. While no formal process exists yet, the current consensus is that modules should only be moved when they meet specific criteria such as wide usage, maturity, or inclusion in a Mage-OS release.\n\nTask #59 in Taiga is tracking the development of formal acceptance criteria. Feel free to help with the ticket!\n\n---\n\n### DeepWiki Integration\n\nA set of Mage-OS repositories has been indexed by [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com), providing AI-powered, explorable documentation for:\n\n- [mageos-magento2](https://deepwiki.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2)\n\n- [infrastructure](https://deepwiki.com/mage-os/infrastructure)\n\n- [github-actions](https://deepwiki.com/mage-os/github-actions)\n\n- [terraform](https://deepwiki.com/mage-os/terraform)\n\n- [generate-mirror-repo-js](https://deepwiki.com/mage-os/generate-mirror-repo-js)\n\nThis makes our codebase and tooling more accessible for newcomers and contributors alike..\n\n---\n\n### Community Discussions & RFCs\n\nA few important technical proposals are under discussion:\n\nIdeas for improving build and release independence of Mage-OS packages were raised — helpful for contributors managing their own version cycles.\n\n**Semantic Versioning RFC**: Should Mage-OS adopt semantic versioning to signal breaking changes more clearly?

Shiny! Available now!","We’re excited to announce a major milestone for the Mage-OS community: Artem has officially released the Admin Theme for Mage-OS, bringing a fresh, modern look...","We’re excited to announce a major milestone for the Mage-OS community: [Artem](https://www.linkedin.com/in/artem-kozynets) has officially [released](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/artem-kozynets_github-mage-os-labtheme-adminhtml-m137-activity-7315480759618736128-Tpft?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABUaYtIBKBOe9-aESwhKh4_njhnvo98UZxQ) the **Admin Theme for Mage-OS**, bringing a fresh, modern look to the Magento-derived platform's admin panel.\n\nThat’s right: the brand-new **Admin Theme** is live — and it’s a game changer for the Magento 2.4, Adobe Commerce, or Mage-OS admin panel. It’s clean. It’s modern. And the best part? You can install it today with just a few Composer commands!\n\n### This is Artem’s Work — and It’s Outstanding\n\nThis entire effort is the result of Artem’s initiative, creativity, and expertise. Developed in his personal time, the Admin Theme reflects his long-standing commitment to the Magento ecosystem and Mage-OS community. It’s a testament to what individuals can achieve when they care deeply about the platform and its future.\n\nHis contribution doesn’t just provide a better user experience — it raises the bar for what Mage-OS can offer. And it’s a great reminder that anyone in the community can help move things forward, just like Artem has.\n\n### What’s the theme all about?\n\n- **Fresh new look** for the admin panel\n\n- Better **contrast**, **typography**, and **layout**\n\n- A faster, more comfortable experience for merchants, devs, support folks — anyone who lives in the backend\n\n- Fully open source, lightweight, and works out of the box with Mage-OS (and Magento 2.4+)\n\n- **Compatible with Mage-OS 1.0 and 1.1**\n\n- **Compatible with Magento 2.4**\n\n- **Usable with Adobe Commerce 2.4** (but compatibility with Commerce features not guaranteed)\n\nInstall it with:\n\n```\ncomposer require mage-os/theme-adminhtml-m137bin/magento setup:upgrade\n```\n\nLinks:\n\n- Theme: [github.com/mage-os-lab/theme-adminhtml-m137](https://github.com/mage-os-lab/theme-adminhtml-m137)\n\n- Switcher: [github.com/mage-os-lab/module-theme-adminhtml-switcher](https://github.com/mage-os-lab/module-theme-adminhtml-switcher)\n\n- Figma design system: [figma.com/community/file/1486802857979032188/m137-design-system-and-ui-kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1486802857979032188/m137-design-system-and-ui-kit)\n\n### A Clean, Modern UX for the Admin Panel\n\nThe Admin Theme delivers a sleek, professional interface that stays true to the spirit of Magento while pushing its visual design into the modern era. Clear typography, improved color contrast, and a refined layout make the admin experience more pleasant and productive for developers, merchants, and support teams alike.\n\nScreenshots shared by early adopters show a crisp and visually balanced UI that dramatically improves the feel of the default admin dashboard—while remaining lightweight and compatible with Mage-OS out of the box.\n\n![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/category-categories-inventory-catalog-1024x883.png)\n\n![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/configuration-settings-stores-magento-admin-m137-admin-theme-1024x497.png)\n\n![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/dashboard-mage-os-admin-1024x581.png)\n\n![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/pages-elements-content-mage-os-dmin-1024x497.png)\n\n### Why This Matters\n\nAs Mage-OS continues to gain traction as a community-driven fork of Magento Open Source, having high-quality frontend and backend experiences is key to encouraging adoption. Artem’s work provides exactly that: a more intuitive and aesthetically pleasing admin interface, built by someone deeply embedded in the Magento and Mage-OS ecosystem.\n\nThe **Admin Theme + Switcher** simplifies the testing and adoption process by letting you switch between the old and new theme directly from the admin panel—great for agencies, theme developers, and site maintainers.\n\nThe [**M137 Design System**](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1486802857979032188/m137-design-system-and-ui-kit) lets you design your own admin components and mockups easily in Figma.\n\n### Powered by Community — and You Can Help\n\nBoth the theme and the switcher module are part of the **Mage-OS Lab**, an open-source space for experimentation and innovation. They’re free to use, open to contributions, and designed to encourage collaboration.\n\nWork like this is only possible thanks to individual contributors like Artem — and through the support of our **Mage-OS Partners** and members. Their backing helps fund infrastructure, coordination, and initiatives that directly benefit the community.\n\nIf you're passionate about Magento or Mage-OS, consider contributing — whether it’s code, design, testing, or financial support. Everyone can play a role.\n\n### Get Involved\n\nBoth the theme and switcher module are open source under the Mage-OS Lab umbrella. If you're using Mage-OS, consider giving the new theme a try and providing feedback. Contributions, pull requests, and issue reports are more than welcome.\n\nWith contributions like this, Mage-OS continues to evolve as a flexible, modern, and community-centric ecommerce platform. Hats off to Artem for helping move the ecosystem forward in such a visible and valuable way.\n\nIf you like what you see, consider supporting the Mage-OS project. Financial contributions don’t just keep the lights on—they enable visible progress, boost morale, and encourage more developers to step forward with their own ideas.\n\n### **Opportunities**\n\n- Have a contribution idea or interested in the Mage-OS Distribution? Join our weekly tech meetings, public on [Discord](http://chat.mage-os.org/) at 3 PM CET / 2 PM UTC / 9 AM EST every Tuesday: chat.mage-os.org\n\n- We’re looking for new features to enhance Mage-OS this year that will help to modernize and excite merchants.

This release packs one huge...",[18],"We are excited to announce the release of Mage-OS Distribution 1.1.0, a milestone in the development of our community project!\n\nThis release packs one huge change, some major ones and many minor security improvements, for the biggest release we've ever had!\n\nBut first of all, let's start with...\n\n## Our foundation\n\nMage-OS 1.1 is built on Magento Open Source 2.4.8, and includes all platform updates and community fixes from the upstream release. See the full [Magento Open Source 2.4.8 Release Notes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-operations/release/notes/magento-open-source/2-4-8) for details.\n\nAs part of that, Mage-OS 1.1 adds support for PHP 8.4, drops support for PHP 8.1, and requires OpenSearch 2.x going forward.\n\nThe latest recommended software versions are:\n\n| Composer      | 2.8                       |\n| ------------- | ------------------------- |\n| Elasticsearch | \\-- (no longer supported) |\n| OpenSearch    | 2.19                      |\n| MariaDB       | 11.4                      |\n| MySQL         | 8.4                       |\n| PHP           | 8.4/8.3                   |\n| RabbitMQ      | 4                         |\n| Redis         | Valkey 8 (or Redis 7.2+)  |\n| Varnish       | 7.6                       |\n| Apache        | 2.4                       |\n| nginx         | 1.26                      |\n\n## A new backend experience\n\nThanks to the hard work of **Artem Kozynets**, one of the members of our community, we're proud to announce that Mage-OS 1.1 includes a completely redesigned theme for the admin panel!\n\n![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mage-os-110-dashboard-936x1024.png)\n\nThis is not just a quick style, it's a complete design system inspired by Material Design 3. The design system is [available for you to preview and use on Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1486802857979032188/m137-design-system-and-ui-kit). We would like to extend a huge thank you to Artem for all of his effort and dedication here.\n\nThis is such a big change that we've dedicated [a full blog post to it](/?p=4400)!\n\n## Major performance improvements\n\nIn addition to the new admin theme, we've chosen to bundle the [Creatuity Compiled Interceptors](https://github.com/creatuity/magento2-interceptors) open source module. Thank you to Franciszek Wawrzak for his tireless work creating and maintaining this solution.\n\nThis module changes the way Magento 2 generates Interceptor classes (a mechanism that allows plugins to work together), to make plugins faster to execute. This is a drop-in replacement for Magento's normal interceptor classes.

[David Lambauer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-lambauer/), founder of [run_as_root](https://www.linkedin.com/company/71741887/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3BqRI8KbhuTbChp2cLzKcXbg%3D%3D), has been at the forefront of improving Magento documentation through innovative approaches, leveraging AI and open-source collaboration.\n\n### **Who is David Lambauer?**\n\nDavid Lambauer is a seasoned developer and entrepreneur with a deep passion for open-source software and high-quality development practices. His journey into the tech world began with a traditional German Fachinformatiker apprenticeship (IT Specialist Training), followed by university studies in computer science. However, his real expertise was shaped through hands-on experience in the industry, particularly in Magento development.\n\n### **How Did He End Up with Magento?**\n\nDavid was introduced to Magento while working at his first workplace, at Netz98, under the mentorship of [Christian Münch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-muench/). His first real test came when he attempted a Magento-related coding challenge. After spending an entire day on it, Münch demonstrated a far more efficient solution in just a few minutes—an eye-opening moment that inspired him to fully commit to learning Magento.\n\nHe later expanded his knowledge in infrastructure and scalable systems. These experiences paved the way for him to launch his own agency, run_as_root, with a focus on high-quality Magento solutions.\n\n### **run_as_root: A New Approach to Magento Development**\n\nFounded with the goal of simplifying Magento development, run_as_root emphasizes long-term client relationships and transparency. Unlike traditional agencies that focus on constantly acquiring new clients, run_as_root is dedicated to providing sustainable, well-documented, and high-quality solutions. One of its standout features is its detailed, automated billing system, which ensures that clients know exactly what they’re paying for.\n\n### **How Did He Develop AI-Generated Magento Documentation?**\n\nOne of David’s biggest contributions to the Magento community is his work on developer documentation. After Adobe acquired Magento, there was concern over the future of open-source contributions. During this time, David was already contributing to Magento's DevDocs and saw an opportunity to improve them using automation.\n\nTo address this, he created [Dev Docs v1.0](https://devdocs.mage-os.org/docs/main), a documentation project designed to help new developers get started with Magento.\n\nUsing GPT-3.5, he built an AI-powered system that could generate well-structured developer documentation. He based his approach on Laravel’s documentation model, where content is stored as Markdown files in a repository. His process included:\n\n1. Creating a structured outline of essential Magento topics using AI.\n\n2. Generating content for each topic with AI assistance.\n\n3. Formatting everything into Markdown, making it easy to maintain and update.\n\nTo make improvements easier, he also added an \"Edit on GitHub\" button, allowing anyone to contribute fixes or updates. This method leverages a simple reality: people are more likely to correct mistakes than to write new documentation from scratch.\n\n### **What Were the Challenges?**\n\nDespite its success, developing AI-driven documentation wasn’t without obstacles:\n\n- **Ensuring Accuracy**: AI-generated content needed manual review to ensure reliability.\n\n- **Building a Solid Knowledge Base**: The documentation had to cover enough depth to be useful.\n\n- **Keeping Up with AI Improvements**: AI models continue to evolve, meaning the process needs to be updated over time.\n\nDavid continues to explore new ways to refine AI-generated documentation. One possibility is an AI-assisted query system, where instead of reading static documentation, developers ask an AI assistant questions and receive real-time responses based on well-structured prompts.\n\n### **How Does He Want to Continue Developing the Documentation?**\n\nDavid sees multiple ways to evolve Magento documentation further:\n\n1. **Enhancing AI-Generated Documentation** – Using more advanced AI models like GPT-4 and future iterations to improve content quality, making it more detailed and technically accurate.\n\n2. **AI-Driven Interactive Assistance** – Instead of static documentation, an AI-powered chatbot or search tool could provide tailored answers to developer questions in real time.\n\n3. **Crowdsourced Community Contributions** – Expanding community involvement by making it easier for developers to suggest edits, provide examples, and validate content.\n\n4. **Integrating Documentation into Development Tools** – Embedding documentation directly into developer environments, making it accessible while coding.\n\n5. **Iterative Prompting for Higher Quality** – Structuring AI-generated documentation by first defining tone, keywords, reference materials, and output formats before generating final content.\n\nThese approaches reflect Lambauer’s commitment to making Magento documentation more dynamic, accessible, and reliable for developers worldwide.\n\n### **What Does He Like About Magento?**\n\nDavid appreciates Magento for its **maturity and strong developer community**. Unlike other platforms where basic coding practices are still debated, the Magento ecosystem fully embraces advanced development methodologies like Unit Testing, Integration Testing, and Continuous Integration/Deployment.\n\nHe also values Magento’s flexibility and scalability, making it an excellent choice for complex e-commerce solutions. Its open-source nature encourages innovation and long-term community contributions.\n\n### **What Is His Relation to Mage-OS?**\n\nMage-OS was created in response to the slowdown in Magento’s open-source development after Adobe’s acquisition.

His journey into the tech world began with a traditional German Fachinformatiker apprenticeship (IT Specialist Training), followed by university studies in computer science. However, his real expertise was shaped through hands-on experience in the industry, particularly in Magento development.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"how-did-he-end-up-with-magento\">\u003Cstrong>How Did He End Up with Magento?\u003C/strong>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>David was introduced to Magento while working at his first workplace, at Netz98, under the mentorship of \u003Ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-muench/\">Christian Münch\u003C/a>. His first real test came when he attempted a Magento-related coding challenge. After spending an entire day on it, Münch demonstrated a far more efficient solution in just a few minutes—an eye-opening moment that inspired him to fully commit to learning Magento.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>He later expanded his knowledge in infrastructure and scalable systems.

After Adobe acquired Magento, there was concern over the future of open-source contributions.

He based his approach on Laravel’s documentation model, where content is stored as Markdown files in a repository.

This remarkable event was dedicated to Magento developers and eCommerce professionals. But this was more than just a technical conference. It was a gathering of like-minded individuals, celebrating community, collaboration, and shared purpose.\n\n**New milestones for the Hyvä ecosystem** were unveiled during the event, including **Hyvä Commerce**—a suite of products enhancing Magento Open Source with a modern admin panel and advanced features—and **Hyvä CMS**, a fully redesigned content management system built for flexibility and usability. These innovations are a testament to the fact that, with strong community support, Magento remains one of the most powerful and adaptable eCommerce platforms.\n\n---\n\n### **A Community at the Center: Unity Through Collaboration**\n\nOne of the clearest takeaways from these action-packed days was a renewed awareness: **Magento still holds a vital place in the eCommerce world**, but maintaining that position requires collective effort. The presence of **Mage-OS** and the **Magento Association** as community sponsors underscored the importance of joining forces to strengthen and evolve the Magento ecosystem.\n\nMany Mage-OS contributors were present, openly discussing what it would take to bring Magento back to the market position it deserves. One message was clear: **collaboration is the only path forward**—between developers, agencies, vendors, and professionals across the industry.\n\nAttending Hyvä Developers Paradise wasn’t just about discovering new tech or hearing the latest product updates. It was about **actively** **participating in a community shaping the future of open-source eCommerce**. Magento remains the only valid alternative for those who value customization, flexibility, and robust capabilities. And it’s this community—when united and energized—that can help the platform survive and thrive.\n\n---\n\n### **Mage-OS and the Power of Open Collaboration**\n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of the event was the **in-depth, real-time dialogue around Mage-OS**—the community-driven fork of Magento. Talking with other developers provided invaluable insights into the platform’s evolution and direction.\n\nDespite coming from different backgrounds, teams, and experiences, everyone shared a common goal: to make Mage-OS a stable, reliable, and forward-thinking alternative.\n\nSome developers have already begun experimenting with Mage-OS in staging environments, while others are even running it in production—evaluating its compatibility with third-party extensions and testing its real-world stability. These trials are critical in identifying strengths, pinpointing gaps, and steering future improvements. The fact that so many professionals are dedicating time and effort to test and contribute to Mage-OS shows how deeply this community believes in its potential.\n\n---\n\n### **A Shared Goal That Knows No Borders**\n\nOne recurring theme in every conversation was the importance of **having a shared vision**. It doesn’t matter where we come from, what language we speak, or what part of the world we’re coding in. What matters is having a **common purpose** and moving forward—together.\n\nMeeting other developers face-to-face drove home the point: without unity, we risk fragmentation, which slows progress. It’s the **community glue**—continuous, open, and constructive dialogue—that holds this ecosystem together. Without it, we risk missing out on the innovations that only collective effort can bring.\n\n---\n\n### **Becoming a Voice for the Community**\n\nOne thing that struck me during the event was how many agencies that have worked with Magento for years **still weren’t aware of Mage-OS**. That realization pushed me to become more than a user—I became an advocate. I spent time talking to teams, sharing what’s been achieved so far, and encouraging them to use Mage-OS and become part of the journey.\n\nMagento has always had a strong community. However, to grow, the project needs not only developers but also agencies, professionals, and stakeholders to get involved. It’s time to move from **passive users to active contributors**—whether that means writing code, giving feedback, improving documentation, or simply spreading the word.\n\nAs Helen Keller once said:  \n**\"Alone, we can do so little; together, we can do so much.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Beyond Code: Human Connections Matter**\n\nHyvä Developers Paradise wasn’t just about code and tech talks. At its heart, this was an event about **people**. Yes, there were deep-dive sessions and technical content—but there were also bowling, tennis matches, dance parties, and sunset drinks by the ocean.\n\nThese shared moments created bonds that went far beyond the professional. Often, **the best ideas come from the most unexpected conversations**—over a drink, during a tennis match, or walking along the beach. The real power of the Magento community lies in this, too: the ability to build authentic relationships around a shared passion.\n\n---\n\n### **Magento Has a Future—But It’s Up to Us**\n\nHyvä Developers Paradise 2025 was a bold reminder that **Magento’s strength isn’t just in the code—it’s in the people who believe in it** and commit to improving it daily.\n\nMore than an event, this was a statement of purpose: **Magento has a bright future—but only if the community stays united, engaged, and committed**.\n\nFor those working with Magento or curious about the future of open-source eCommerce, events like this aren’t just professional opportunities. They’re a chance to contribute to a mission bigger than any single company or product.\n\nMagento needs its community.  \nAnd the community needs Magento.\n\nAs Aristotle once said:  \n**\"The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\"**\n\nNow more than ever, that truth resonates deeply within our community.","src/data/post/2025-05-21-hyva-developers-paradise-2025-the-power-of-community-driving-magentos-future.md","8d723f7fbf287f0f",{"html":2545,"metadata":2546},"\u003Cp>Article by \u003Ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruggerolandolina/\">Ruggero Landolina\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>From February 27 to March 1, 2025, the first-ever \u003Cstrong>Hyvä Developers Paradise\u003C/strong> took place at the Lopesan Baobab Resort in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.

We’d be delighted to hear from you, and help figure out how your idea best fits into Mage-OS!\n\n## Installing Mage-OS\n\nYou can create a new Mage-OS project with the following SSH command:\n\n```\ncomposer create-project --repository-url=https://repo.mage-os.org/ mage-os/project-community-edition .\n```\n\nAfter a successful composer download, you will need to run the installer. Please see [DevDocs: Installation Guide for Mage-OS](https://devdocs.mage-os.org/docs/main)\n\n## Moving to Mage-OS\n\nIf you are already using Magento 2.4 and PHP 8.2+, you can change to Mage-OS by running the following in SSH:\n\n```\ncomposer config repositories.0 composer https://repo.mage-os.org/ &&\n    composer require mage-os/product-community-edition --no-update &&\n    composer remove magento/product-community-edition magento/composer-dependency-version-audit-plugin magento/composer-root-update-plugin --no-update &&\n    composer remove sebastian/comparator --dev --no-update &&\n    composer update --no-plugins --with-all-dependencies\n```\n\nWe strongly recommend updating to the latest Magento version (currently 2.4.8) before changing to Mage-OS, to minimize issues.\n\nYour specific situation may require additional changes to your `composer.json` file. Generally this will involve changing `magento/` package names to `mage-os/`, or updating dependency versions.","src/data/post/2025-06-18-mage-os-1-2-0.md","1dcdaadbcd95dca7",{"html":2583,"metadata":2584},"\u003Cp>We are excited to announce the release of Mage-OS Distribution 1.2.0, another step in the building of the definitive open source e-commerce platform!\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"our-foundation\">Our foundation\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Mage-OS 1.2.0 is built on Magento Open Source 2.4.8-p1, and includes all platform updates and community fixes from the upstream release.

The committee praised the board for cultivating a transparent and cooperative environment, laying a strong foundation for continued success in 2025.\n\n### Thank You\n\nTo everyone who voted, joined the assembly, contributed code, helped with finances, supported others, or just showed up: **thank you**.

It was a sort of counter-event to the Bargento event, which would be less commercial and more organised for and by developers.\n\nIn 2014, the Opengento association was born during MageConf. The idea was simple: to bring together the French developer community for a weekend to code and network! \n\nSince the first Opengento event, which took place in 2015 in Toulouse, seven other weekends have been organized! \n\nTo put it briefly, Opengento is an association that publishes POCs & modules during its hackathons (our famous Opengento weekends) in order to support innovation within the e-commerce developer community.\n\n![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Opengento-weekend-1024x576.jpeg)\n\n# Who is Opengento \n\nThe board is renewed every year and is currently represented by\n\n- A president: Frederic Martinez\n\n- A Treasurer: Christophe Ferreboeuf\n\n- A Secretary: Thomas Klein\n\nToday there are over 150 individual members working for agencies, as freelancers but also for software vendors and merchants too, supported by [13 sponsors](https://opengento.fr/members).\n\nTheir mission is to \n\n- Promote the Magento Open Source initiatives\n\n- Organize events for the Magento Community\n  - Weekend Opengento (developer paradise like)\n  - Meetups (networking)\n\n- Publish Open-Source modules for free on packagist! ([https://github.com/opengento](https://github.com/opengento))\n\n- Share knowledge & expertise (events, Slack)\n\n![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/groupe-drone-1.jpg)\n\n# What innovation has been brought by Opengento?\n\nOpengento came up with a variety of modules that allow you to add several types of loggers (GELF, Slack, and others), or access Magento without a password ([Hoodoor](https://hoodoor.com/))\n\nOther functionalities developed over Opengento Hackathons include:\n\n- geolocation management by country\n\n- GDPR\n\n- Sidegrade Commerce to Open Source\n\n- linking multiple countries to a store\n\n- importing/exporting categories in flat format\n\n- the ability to disable purchasing or pricing for one or more customer groups or by product\n\n- the ability to replace the store code in the URL path with a custom or predefined value (local, for example)\n\n- SSR generation of breadcrumbs (very useful for SEO)\n\n- database management (document management, automated imports, automatic linking to products, search, etc.)\n\n- the ability to manage sales increment IDs (prefix, suffix, format)\n\n- advanced sort management on PLPs (managing the order or no, include it or have a dedicated cta..)\n\n- minimal price management\n\n- currency accuracy management (fork of the official M2-JP which is not maintained)\n\n- webapi logger (fork of ghostunicorn)\n\n- openai connector…\n\n[VIsit Opengento Github Repository here](https://github.com/opengento)\n\n# How does Opengento fit with Adobe, the Magento Association or Mage-OS?\n\n![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20241010_095502-1024x768.jpg)\n\n### Adobe\n\nAdobe is dedicated to maintaining the **Magento Open Source** codebase, a commitment that has been strong since they acquired Magento in 2018. They directly manage the core code, releasing consistent updates that include security fixes and performance enhancements. \n\nFor this, they have been investing in two key people:\n\n**Parul Sinha**, a Software Engineering Manager at Adobe, focuses on fostering stronger ties with the developer community, managing programs that encourage contributions, and advocating for the community's needs to ensure their input shapes the roadmap.\n\n**Ritesh Somani**, a Principal Product Manager at Adobe and a Magento Association board member, contributes to defining the product vision and roadmap, particularly for commerce and payments, and works to strengthen collaboration between Adobe and the community to keep Magento Open Source robust and merchant-focused.\n\nYou can meet them at key Meet Magento events in North America, and together, they work on maintaining the Magento Open Source codebase through initiatives such as:\n\n- [**Community Prioritization Process**,](https://community.magento.com/t5/Magento-DevBlog/bg-p/devblog) to empower the community to influence the roadmap by upvoting pull requests for features and fixes they deem most important.\n\n- **Core Codebase Ownership:** Adobe is the official steward, handling development, security, and compatibility.\n\n- **Regular Releases:** They consistently issue updates, including security fixes and quality improvements, ensuring the platform stays current.\n\n- **Showcasing Magento Open Source** and how it helps SMB merchants scale their eCommerce stores and capabilities at their own pace. \n\n![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250206_093356-1024x768.jpg)\n\n_Presentation of Parking Zone case study by Ritesh at Meet Magento Florida 2025_\n\n### The Magento Association\n\nThe [Magento Association](https://www.magentoassociation.org/home) is backed by Adobe. Their main objective is to promote the Magento brand and eCommerce platform and Community. \n\n- They grant the rights to use the “[Meet Magento](https://www.meet-magento.com/)” branding for events and they provide strong support to those events.\n\n- Now you can refer to the [Magento Open Source official website](https://magento-opensource.com/) to find key resources about the platform’s features, including the key [advantages of Open Source](https://magento-opensource.com/magento-open-source/magento-open-source-open-source-advantage/) vs SaaS in eCommerce\n\n- You can also tag Magento Open Source on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/magento-open-source/) again, to give it more visibility as a brand and code base in its own right, showcasing fantastic projects that go live everyday.\n\nIn the last year or so, the Magento Association gave a big boost to its activities and more clarity to its governance. \n\nHere are their 2025 big priorities and [board members’ roles and responsibilities](https://www.magentoassociation.org/commerce-co-op/full-article/magento-association-march-2025-town-hall-highlights-and-key-takeaways) to achieve their goals:\n\n1\\. Financial Health & Funding the Future \n\n2\\. Membership, Sponsorship & Sustainability \n\n3\\. Events: The Heartbeat of the Community \n\n4\\.

Adobe’s Vision for the Future\n\n![](https://mage-os.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-19-095835.png)\n\nWhat has been quite visible so far is how their Marketing task force, led by Laura Folco staffed up big times with high profile members such as Emily Sturges, Rebecca Brocton and Ola Czapiewska , and you can already see the momentum they are gaining, starting with their [LinkedIn activities](https://www.linkedin.com/company/magentoassociation/posts/?feedView=all).\n\n### Mage-OS\n\nAs a foundation to raise awareness about the structural advantages of the Magento Open Source platform, we gathered all the reasons [why Open Source is beneficial for eCommerce](https://magento-opensource.com/magento-open-source/magento-open-source-open-source-advantage/) merchants, including ownership and control of their stores, data, security, resilience but also unmatched flexibility and differentiation and THE COMMUNITY.\n\nNow that the promotion of the Magento brand is now in safe hands with the Magento Association, we are shifting our focus to becoming a **technology incubator**, giving Magento developers a playground to build and test things such as:\n\n- A brand [new Admin Pane](/?p=4400)l to  make it more modern, intuitive and fun for Magento users!\n\n- [AI powered documentation](/?p=4521) so developers spend more time on what they love and less on tedious tasks\n\n- Automatic [Translation Modules,](/?p=4329) Import/Export for Page Builder Modules\n\n- And [many more](/?cat_ID=40)\n\nOur role is to nurture innovation, and provide opportunities and path to be rolled out into the core platform to maintain its competitive edge and relevance while the eCommerce landscape is undergoing a huge revolution both technology wise but also regulatory wise.\n\n### Localised Magento developers associations: Opengento, Firegento, Magentiamo, Mage-OS Netherlands and more\n\nGrassroot initiatives are at the heart of the Magento Community and is the tightest bond that brings people together. \n\nThe same way Opengento comes up with innovative solutions to problems they see in their markets, other countries also have their local associations:\n\n[**Firegento**](http://firegento.com) **(Germany)**\n\nThe German association (e.V.) with a long history of contributing to Magento Open Source is  known for organizing community events: hackathons, meetups and most importantly [Unconferences](https://www.mageunconference.org/), and developing useful tools and modules for the platform. \n\n**GitHub:** [https://github.com/firegento](https://github.com/firegento)\n\n[**Mage-OS NL**](https://nl.mage-os.org/en/) **(Netherlands)**\n\nLocal chapter of the broader Mage-OS initiative, they are a non-profit association specifically for the Dutch Magento community, aiming to revive and represent the Magento/Adobe Commerce/Mage-OS ecosystem in the Netherlands through events, information sharing, and community facilitation.

Over the past month, we’ve seen progress on technical improvements, community projects, website updates, and leadership changes. Here’s a look at everything that happened recently.\n\n## Community and Leadership\n\n### General Assembly and Elections\n\nMage-OS held its second-ever General Assembly, where members came together to vote on leadership roles and reflect on the progress made so far. A new board was elected for the 2025–2027 term, including:\n\n- Vinai Kopp (President)\n\n- David Lambauer (Vice President)\n\n- Cezary Kozon (Treasurer)\n\n- John Prendergast (Actuary)\n\n- Michiel Gerritsen, Ruggero Landolina, and others as board members\n\n- Francis Michael Gallagher joined the Business Control Committee\n\nThe community also thanked the outgoing board members for their time and dedication. Read more about the General Assembly [here](/?p=4597).\n\n### Finances and Transparency\n\nThe Business Control Committee shared the 2024 financial report, showing that Mage-OS is in strong financial shape. The organization had more than 270,000 PLN in revenue and ended the year with a surplus of over 163,000 PLN. All finances were handled according to Polish nonprofit standards, and regular updates have kept the community informed.\n\n---\n\n## Technical Progress\n\n### Website and Performance\n\n- A new page called the “[Community Modules Directory](/?page_id=4532)” was added to the Mage-OS website. It highlights useful extensions made by the community, organized into different categories, and invites feedback.\n\n- Website performance improved thanks to a new caching plugin, making the site faster for visitors.\n\n### Build Process and Releases\n\n- Work is ongoing to improve how Mage-OS builds and distributes releases. Efforts are focused on reusing existing files and reducing the time needed to build new versions.\n\n- The team is experimenting with ways to run builds in parallel, but some limitations still exist due to tooling and infrastructure.\n\n- [Version 1.2](/?p=4590) was released recently, and early feedback has been very positive. The new admin theme received praise, and no major issues were reported.\n\n## Frontend and Checkout Compliance\n\n### New Theme in Progress\n\nA new default frontend theme is in development. It’s based on the existing Blank theme and uses UIKit 3. The goal is to improve the customer-facing experience while staying compatible with existing modules. A preview version is being prepared for the community to try and give feedback.\n\n### CSP and PCI-DSS Security\n\nCheckout compliance continues to be a high priority. The team is exploring different ways to meet stricter security requirements (like PCI-DSS 4.0). Ideas include removing certain scripts and possibly using sandboxed iframes, similar to what Shopify does. These changes are not easy but are important for long-term security and compatibility with payment providers.\n\n## Community Modules and Contributions\n\n- Several modules have been moved into the official [Mage-OS namespace](https://github.com/mage-os), including [Vinai’s cache-cleaning module](https://github.com/mage-os/magento-cache-clean) and others that were previously hosted in MageOSLab..\n\n- Contributions continue from agencies and developers, showing strong and steady engagement.\n\n---\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\nMage-OS is moving into a new phase focused on innovation and growth.

Known to many as **dadolun95**, Davide is a freelance web developer based in Italy, spending his days crafting Magento solutions and his downtime at the ping pong table.\n\nWith Mage-OS gaining momentum as a true open-source alternative to Adobe's version of Magento, Davide’s contributions, especially in improving content editing and frontend flexibility, are helping redefine what it means to build with Magento in 2025.\n\n## Building a Smarter Page Builder\n\nOne of Davide’s standout contributions is the **[page-builder-widgets](https://github.com/mage-os-lab/module-page-builder-widget)** module, a clever workaround for Magento’s long-standing struggle with user-friendly content management.\n\nPage Builder has always felt like it was missing something critical, Davide explains. Especially when it comes to creating custom components. You end up diving into a labyrinth of UI components and JavaScript structures that barely make sense, even for seasoned Magento devs.\n\nHis module fixes this by allowing CMS widgets to be previewed directly inside Page Builder, complete with the actual data the user enters. Before this, adding a widget meant inserting a shortcode and hoping it worked on the frontend. Now, merchants get real previews, and developers only need a small XML snippet and a PHTML file to make it happen.\n\nThe result is a massive improvement in usability without sacrificing the Magento philosophy of extensibility and modularity.\n\n## The Pain Behind the Progress\n\nBuilding the module wasn’t exactly a walk in the park. Magento’s admin UI is infamously complex, and developing something that integrates cleanly without breaking standards required some serious determination.\n\n\"The hard part was designing its behavior at the UI/UX level in the admin and wiring the various calls needed in the component by untangling xml and js. All without changing any mode in widget development while remaining totally faithful to the standard in use.\" he says. I had to find ways to allow for custom JS, CSS, and backend logic without rewriting the core structure.\n\nDavide also had to account for admin-specific behavior, such as using backend-only block classes, while making the preview system flexible enough to support future use cases. The entire development process took around 10 days of focused, intense work.\n\n> “Developing such a complex uiComponent is in itself something that is debilitating and that leads you on several occasions to think that you will not be able to complete the work” - he admits.\n\n## A Theme for the Future Without Losing the Past\n\nDavide isn’t just looking at Page Builder; he has his eyes on the frontend, too. His next big proposal involves revamping Magento’s default theme Luma to make it more modern, flexible, and compliant with evolving digital standards.\n\nInstead of replacing Luma entirely, he’s building a new Blank-based theme that incorporates **[UIkit3](https://getuikit.com/docs/introduction)**, a lightweight frontend framework that works perfectly with Magento’s static content deploy process. Unlike other modern frontend stacks, it doesn’t require Node.js or a custom build toolchain. It compiles via LESS, just like Magento expects.\n\n> \"We cannot afford as an opensource community to have to tell those who want to use the software we support \u003C\u003C You have to install theme X or module Y to be able to sell online >> and vendors cannot be asked to make an extra effort to adapt to yet another new 'standard.'\"\n\nThis new theme brings in responsive design utilities, UI components, and a faster path to modern layouts, all while preserving compatibility with Magento’s frontend architecture.\n\nIt’s already in beta, and Davide has shared it with the Mage-OS community for feedback. The next steps include refining it to meet regulatory requirements like the EU’s Cyber Resilience Act and eventually tackling Magento’s checkout experience, which still lacks proper CSP compliance.\n\n## From Early Magento to Open-Source Advocacy\n\nDavide discovered Magento back in 2016, when Magento 1 was still the dominant version and Magento 2 hadn’t yet stabilized. He was working at a company that used the platform and quickly fell in love with its structure and power.\n\n> The flexibility it gives you, with dependency injection, plugins, preferences, is just unmatched, he says. If you know what you’re doing, you can really shape it to your business.\n\nAfter going freelance in 2020, he began focusing more on community-led efforts, which is what eventually brought him to Mage-OS.\n\n## Why Mage-OS Matters to Him\n\nMage-OS isn’t just a technical fork, for Davide, it’s a chance to give back to a platform that’s shaped his career. Adobe’s stewardship of Magento left many community members feeling locked out. Mage-OS gave them a new way in.\n\n> Mage-OS lets me contribute directly without all the limitations and red tape, Davide says. \"I owe a lot to Magento in terms of my own career so I'm glad to pay my 'debt' to it and that thanks to Mage-OS.\"\n\nHe’s not alone in seeing Mage-OS as the spiritual successor to the Magento many developers first fell in love with a project led by people who actually use and build with it every day.\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\nWith the Page Builder Widgets module released, the frontend theme in beta, and a vision to bring widgets, layouts, and admin tools into a more modern ecosystem, Davide’s work is helping Mage-OS move from potential to reality.\n\n> There’s still a lot to do, he says. But we’re at the point where we can finally make Magento or Mage-OS fun again.\n\nWhether it's giving non-developers better tools or improving compatibility for third-party developers, Davide’s contributions are a reminder of what open source is supposed to be: practical, inclusive, and community-driven.\n\nAnd with developers like him in the mix, the future of Mage-OS looks a whole lot brighter.","src/data/post/2025-07-14-revitalizing-magento-through-mage-os-and-smarter-frontend-design.md","8e4b7442d4eebbbc",{"html":2826,"metadata":2827},"\u003Cp>In a world where Magento has often felt caught between its open-source roots and corporate oversight, \u003Cem>\u003Ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davide-lunardon-b78813a1/\">Davide Lunardon\u003C/a>\u003C/em> is one of the developers pushing it back toward its community-driven origins.

The first stop is [**Meet Magento Ukraine on September 4**](https://ua.meet-magento.com/en/), an excellent chance to connect with fellow Mage-OS contributors, merchants, and community members. We’d love to see you there.\n\nAnd this is just the beginning, **more community events are scheduled in the coming weeks**. Take a look at our [events calendar](/?page_id=2587), join in, share your insights, and be part of strengthening the Mage-OS ecosystem.\n\n## **Technical Progress**\n\n## **Mage-OS 1.3.0 Release**\n\nWe’re happy to announce that **Mage-OS Distribution 1.3.0** is officially out! Built on Magento Open Source 2.4.8-p2, it includes all upstream updates as well as community-driven fixes.\n\nHighlights of this release:\n\n- **Foundation:** Based on Magento Open Source 2.4.8-p2 with all upstream updates.\n\n- **Recommended stack:** Composer 2.8, OpenSearch 2.19, MariaDB 11.4 / MySQL 8.4, PHP 8.4 or 8.3, RabbitMQ 4, Valkey 8 (or Redis 7.2+), Varnish 7.6, Apache 2.4, nginx 1.26.\n\n- **Backend theme updates:** Freshened icons, cleaner newsletter and email template views, optimized data grids and modals, improved media galleries, refactored URL rewrites, and better LESS configuration.\n\n- **Bug fixes:** Addressed JavaScript errors, improved integration tests, enhanced LESS handling, and expanded city validation rules.\n\nA big thank you goes to all contributors: Artem Kozynets, Bhushan Kumar, Fabrizio Balliano, Lucas van Staden, Ryan Hoerr, Simon Humeau (Antadis), Vinai Kopp, Vova Yatsyuk, and many others for making this release happen. \n\nRead the full release notes [here](/?p=4796).\n\n## **Project Archiving**\n\nTo bring more clarity to active projects, the **Web Installer** and **Backup Module** have been archived.\n\n- **Why:** Lack of maintenance and unresolved issues, never reaching a stable release.\n\n- **Note:** Any project can be revived if a maintainer steps up.\n\n- **Goal:** Reduce clutter and highlight what’s actively maintained.\n\n## **New Module: Theme Optimization**\n\nWe’re happy to introduce the **Theme Optimization Module** by Ryan.\n\n- Delivers smooth **page transitions** on both frontend and backend for a faster, more polished user experience.\n\n- Already included in Mage-OS packages and listed in the community directory.\n\n- Future plans include possible **BFCache support** to make browsing even faster.\n\n## **Mage-OS 2.0 – Coming in October**\n\nWork continues on **Mage-OS 2.0**, targeted for October 2025. Our release strategy is to provide **two major updates per year**, independent of Adobe Magento’s cycle.\n\nCandidate modules being considered:\n\n- Meta Robots Tag\n\n- Theme Optimization\n\n- Potential AI-related tools\n\nWe’re also debating how to package Mage-OS best:\n\n- A **full bundle** with many features included.\n\n- A **lean core** with add-ons available as needed.\n\n- Or even multiple “flavors” (minimal vs. full-featured) generated through a custom installer.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n## **Technical Work in Progress**\n\nRyan is working on **independent module versioning** to give more modular control. This will:\n\n- Simplify maintenance.\n\n- Allow cleaner, more flexible updates.\n\n## **Opportunities**\n\nMage-OS is built by the community, for the community. You can help by:\n\n- Have a contribution idea or interested in the Mage-OS Distribution?

Mage-OS...",[18],"We are excited to announce the release of Mage-OS Distribution 1.3.1, another step in the building of the definitive open source e-commerce platform!\n\nMage-OS 1.3.1 is built on Magento Open Source 2.4.8-p2, and **includes an important security update** from Magento Open Source that was released just this morning.\n\nThis update fixes vulnerability CVE-2025-54236, by applying the official Adobe security patch to Mage-OS. There are no other changes from Mage-OS 1.3.0.\n\nSecurity Bulletin: [APSB25-88](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/magento/apsb25-88.html)  \nMagento Security Patch: [Action Required: Critical Security Update Available for Adobe Commerce  (APSB25-88)](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-cloud-kcs/kbarticles/ka-27397)\n\n**Please update any Mage-OS instances to version 1.3.1 as soon as possible to prevent security issues.**\n\n```\ncomposer require mage-os/product-community-edition:1.3.1\nbin/magento setup:upgrade\n```\n\nIf you have Magento or Adobe Commerce, you will need to apply the Adobe security patch available through the link above.\n\n## Want to participate?\n\nAre you interested in contributing to Mage-OS, or have a bug or improvement you’d like to make? **We welcome pull requests** at [https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-magento2)!\n\nIf you have a bigger project in mind, please [join Discord](http://chat.mage-os.org/) and chat about your idea. We’d be delighted to hear from you, and help figure out how your idea best fits into Mage-OS!\n\n## Installing Mage-OS\n\nYou can create a new Mage-OS project with the following SSH command:\n\n```\ncomposer create-project --repository-url=https://repo.mage-os.org/ mage-os/project-community-edition .\n```\n\nAfter a successful composer download, you will need to run the installer. Please see [DevDocs: Installation Guide for Mage-OS](https://devdocs.mage-os.org/docs/main)\n\n## Moving to Mage-OS\n\nIf you are already using Magento 2.4 and PHP 8.2+, you can change to Mage-OS by running the following in SSH:\n\n```\ncomposer config repositories.0 composer https://repo.mage-os.org/ &&\n    composer require mage-os/product-community-edition --no-update &&\n    composer remove magento/product-community-edition magento/composer-dependency-version-audit-plugin magento/composer-root-update-plugin --no-update &&\n    composer remove sebastian/comparator --dev --no-update &&\n    composer update --no-plugins --with-all-dependencies\n```\n\nWe strongly recommend updating to the latest Magento version (currently 2.4.8) before changing to Mage-OS, to minimize issues.\n\nYour specific situation may require additional changes to your `composer.json` file. Generally this will involve changing `magento/` package names to `mage-os/`, or updating dependency versions.","src/data/post/2025-09-09-mage-os-1-3-1-is-out.md","02d454675bf9641d",{"html":2992,"metadata":2993},"\u003Cp>We are excited to announce the release of Mage-OS Distribution 1.3.1, another step in the building of the definitive open source e-commerce platform!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Mage-OS 1.3.1 is built on Magento Open Source 2.4.8-p2, and \u003Cstrong>includes an important security update\u003C/strong> from Magento Open Source that was released just this morning.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This update fixes vulnerability CVE-2025-54236, by applying the official Adobe security patch to Mage-OS.

Gallagher’](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francismgallagher/)s journey into the world of Magento, and later Mage-OS, began almost by accident. In 2012, while still fresh out of university, Francis was looking for a new direction after an early success in anime streaming ran into legal trouble. A friend mentioned a job opening for a Magento developer. Although he had never worked with Magento before, his years of coding since age fourteen gave him the confidence to try.\n\nAt the interview, the hiring team knew little about PHP or Magento, so he wrote his own interview questions and tasks, passing “with flying colors”. Within his first two weeks he launched two small Magento sites and quickly proved his talent. What started as a junior developer role soon became a career that moved through agencies and well-known retailers such as Oh Polly and Trespass.\n\n### **Finding a Home in the Magento Community**\n\nFrancis quickly discovered that Magento was more than just an e-commerce platform, it was a vibrant community. In the early days he sought help in IRC channels, but before long he was the one providing it. He became an “OP”, essentially a Slack-style administrator, and found a professional home.\n\nOther frameworks he worked with, such as Laravel or Drupal, never gave him the same sense of belonging. Magento’s culture of openness and collaboration kept him engaged and inspired.\n\n### **Mage-OS: A New Chapter**\n\nWhen Adobe’s stewardship of Magento created uncertainty, the open-source community rallied. In 2021, an open letter to Adobe helped spark Mage-OS, a community-driven fork and incubator for innovation. For Francis, who had long relied on Magento’s vibrant community for support and growth, Mage-OS felt like a natural continuation of the values he cherished: openness, collaboration, and grassroots empowerment.\n\nHe immediately recognized its potential and committed to supporting this “new invigorated part of the community”. Mage-OS aims to nurture grassroots development and provide a platform where contributors can rely on the association’s technical and marketing muscle. Francis describes it as an “incubator” for open-source projects: a place where developers can build freely, get feedback from experienced peers, and see their work gain visibility and adoption.\n\n_Note from Mage-OS: We truly welcome anyone with fresh ideas or a passion for Magento to reach out, get involved, and explore how we can help bring those ideas to life._\n\n### **Challenges and Opportunities**\n\nFor Francis, the greatest challenge in community projects is not generating ideas but turning them into action. People often bring excellent concepts, but few have the time or confidence to carry them forward. He stresses the need for _psychological safety_, a culture where contributors can experiment, fail, and learn without fear.\n\nMarketing and visibility are also recurring concerns. Many developers outside Mage-OS’s inner circle are unaware of its ongoing work because they rarely check Discord, LinkedIn, or the project’s website. Francis advocates for more frequent, bite-sized updates and grassroots events to keep the wider community engaged. \n\n### **Grassroots Events and Local Engagement**\n\nFrancis believes smaller, local meet-ups are key to sustaining excitement between major annual conferences. He envisions informal gatherings (pizza, beer, and lightning talks) similar to the meet-ups organized by the Umbraco community. These events lower the barrier to entry, allowing developers and small agencies to network and share ideas without the high costs of big conferences.\n\n_We would be happy if community members volunteered to organize such events at the local level. Anyone interested can reach out directly through the Mage-OS Discord to get support and connect with others._\n\nSuch grassroots engagement, he argues, is how Mage-OS can remain visible, attract new contributors, and ensure that the spirit of Magento’s open-source heritage thrives.\n\n### **Looking Ahead**\n\nFrancis M. Gallagher’s story reflects the evolution of the Magento ecosystem itself: from scrappy beginnings to a mature, collaborative network of professionals. His commitment to Mage-OS demonstrates how individuals can shape the future of open source, not just through code, but by fostering community, encouraging innovation, and creating spaces where others can grow.\n\nAs Mage-OS continues to expand, Francis’ vision of transparent governance, strong community support, and grassroots connection offers a roadmap for how open-source projects can remain vibrant and relevant for years to come.","src/data/post/2025-09-30-from-anime-streams-to-open-source-dreams.md","f88c7581493360e0",{"html":3014,"metadata":3015},"\u003Ch3 id=\"from-accidental-magento-developer-to-community-builder\">\u003Cstrong>From Accidental Magento Developer to Community Builder\u003C/strong>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/francismgallagher/\">Francis M.

While the event was more marketing-oriented with fewer technical sessions, the networking opportunities and community feedback were valuable. Suggestions were made to improve Mage-OS visibility at future events.\n\nVinai shared impressions from [Meet Magento Kiev](https://ua.meet-magento.com/en/), highlighting both the normal rhythm of city life and the strong local community connections. His presentation on [Hyvä certifications](https://www.hyva.io/hyva-certification.html) was well received.\n\nLooking ahead, [Meet Magento Netherlands](https://www.meet-magento.com/meet-magento-netherlands-november-6-2025/) takes place on November 6, with a [Mage-OS hackathon](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pre-mm25nl-hackaton-tickets-1658933638169) hosted by the Dutch chapter the day before.\n\n## **Demo Environment Improvements**\n\nWork on the demo environment has been a major focus this month. The setup now automatically resets every six hours, ensuring a fresh state for testing and exploration. The sample data installation workflow has been fixed, resolving earlier reliability issues.\n\nThe environment now runs with PHP 8.3, OpenSearch, and Redis enabled. Some issues remain with category images not displaying, likely due to file permission or product type differences, but these are being investigated. Discussions around robots.txt confirmed that Magento’s configuration already covers this.\n\nVarnish activation is being considered to further improve caching and performance. There were also suggestions to include the UI Kit theme in the demo, possibly add multiple store views, and clearly document which modules and themes are included to avoid confusion when comparing with default installations.\n\nThe demo repository is now public: [mage-os-lab/demo.mage-os.org](https://github.com/mage-os-lab/demo.mage-os.org).\n\n## **Releases and Repository Management**\n\n[Mage-OS 1.3.1](/?p=4884) was released earlier this month. Some issues with missing historical JSON data in the build process were quickly resolved.\n\nThe work on Mage-OS 2.0 continues. Review of bundled community modules shows that most adjustments are minor and fixes are in progress. The release process refactor, including improved version management, is ready pending final approval. Preview builds are recommended before merging into production.\n\nThe package generator saw important improvements this month, including structural refactoring for maintainability. These changes were merged after broad agreement during the technical meetings. Further refinements and minor releases are planned, including compatibility updates for PHP 8.4.\n\n## **Performance and Frontend Work**\n\nThe theme optimization module continues to evolve. Back-Forward Cache (BF Cache) support has been implemented and merged. Additional enhancements such as VCL configuration adjustments are under discussion, though not urgent.\n\nThe UI Kit work is progressing with a focus on removing Knockout.js and reducing RequireJS dependencies for specific page types. The goal is a lighter, faster storefront experience, while balancing compatibility with third-party modules. Related work on performance modules is also underway.\n\n## **Modules and Ecosystem**\n\nSeveral community and lab modules received updates, including a geoIP redirect module and a new caching module for configurable and bundle product variants. Module management and versioning remain an active area of discussion, particularly around whether to lock dependencies or allow greater flexibility.\n\n## **Technical Highlights**\n\n- A new version of **Magerun** was released with support for creating Magento 2 module skeletons.\n\n- Experiments with **headless Magento demos** showcased GraphQL API usage and potential for multi-platform storefronts.\n\n- CSP compliance improvements remain on the agenda, with ongoing discussions about GDPR and security considerations.\n\n- The SeaVoice bot continues to provide free meeting transcription, working with around 80-90% accuracy.\n\n## **Opportunities**\n\nMage-OS is built by the community, for the community.

This release...",[18],"We are excited to announce the release of **Mage-OS Distribution 2.0**, a major milestone that shows the power of community-driven innovation. This release represents a significant step forward in Mage-OS's commitment to advancing open-source e-commerce.\n\n## Our Foundation\n\nMage-OS 2.0 builds on **Magento Open Source 2.4.8-p3**, including all the latest security fixes and platform improvements from the upstream release. This ensures that our distribution maintains the solid foundation that hundreds of thousands of developers and merchants worldwide depend on, while adding the improvements that make Mage-OS special.​\n\n### See recommended software versions\n\n| **Component** | **Recommended Version**  |\n| ------------- | ------------------------ |\n| Composer      | 2.8                      |\n| OpenSearch    | 2.19                     |\n| MariaDB       | 11.4                     |\n| MySQL         | 8.4                      |\n| PHP           | 8.4/8.3                  |\n| RabbitMQ      | 4                        |\n| Redis         | Valkey 8 (or Redis 7.2+) |\n| Varnish       | 7.6                      |\n| Apache        | 2.4                      |\n| nginx         | 1.26                     |\n\n## Version and Support Policy\n\nWe adopted a new versioning policy, starting with Mage-OS 1.2 in June. This is our first major update.\n\n- **#.0.0** **Major Updates**\n  - 2x per year, around April/May and October.\n  - These may include new features, useful bundled extensions, significant changes, or changes to system requirements like PHP versions.\n  - They should stay mostly compatible with Magento and existing extensions, allowing you to easily switch between Mage-OS and Magento.\n\n- **2.#.0 Minor Updates**\n  - Any Magento release or security patch between a feature release will become a Mage-OS minor version update, unless there is a change in system requirements.\n  - These should be compatible with existing installations.​\n\n- **2.0.# Patch Updates**\n  - Small but critical off-schedule fixes to a Mage-OS release. These should be rare.​\n\nThis reflects our plan for more rapid releases and innovation, and lets everyone know and plan for updates in advance.\n\nAdobe announced plans to release security patches on the second Tuesday of each month in 2026. Mage-OS will publish an update each time with the latest security patches included.\n\nAs a mostly-volunteer-run nonprofit, our resources are limited. As such, for now, Mage-OS will only support the latest release branch at a time. You must stay up to date with the latest Mage-OS release to stay secure.\n\n## The [Mage-OS Lab](https://github.com/mage-os-lab): Where Innovation Develops\n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of Mage-OS 2.0 is that **we've graduated multiple Mage-OS Lab modules** into the core distribution. The [Mage-OS Lab](https://github.com/mage-os-lab) is our innovation space, where we welcome everyone in the community to experiment, improve, and perfect new ideas and improvements for the Magento ecosystem.\n\nThe Lab represents our future of open-source Magento: **collaborative, experimental, and community-driven**. It's where new ideas are tested, improved, and ultimately brought to life for the benefit of the entire ecosystem.\n\nThese modules represent months of dedicated work by talented developers who believe in pushing the platform forward.\n\n## New Features\n\n### Enhanced Security with PCI DSS 4.0 Compliance\n\nMage-OS 2.0 bundles the **aligent/magento2-pci-4-compatibility** module, which updates default admin policies for PCI DSS 4.0 requirements. This includes:​\n\n- **Automatic account deactivation** after 90 days of inactivity\n\n- **Enhanced session security** with 15-minute idle timeout enforcement\n\n- **Strengthened authentication** with improved lockout policies\n\n- **More strict password requirements** with 12-character minimum length and complexity rules\n\n### AI-Powered Automatic Translation\n\nThe **Automatic Translation module** changes how merchants expand globally. This powerful tool uses AI services from DeepL, OpenAI, or Google Gemini to provide:\n\n- **Product catalog translation** with support for both text and select/multiselect attributes\n\n- **Automated cron-based translation workflows** for hands-off operation\n\n- **Manual translation controls** for categories, CMS pages, and static blocks\n\n- **Intelligent retranslation prevention** that respects manual edits while adapting to source changes\n\nUse of AI translation requires a separate AI service account and API key, and will involve costs by usage.\n\n### Advanced Inventory Management\n\nThe new **Inventory Reservations Grid** brings better visibility to your inventory management, allowing you to directly see and manage stock reservations in Magento's inventory system.\n\n### SEO Tuning Made Simple\n\nThe **Meta Robots Tag module** gives you detailed control over search engine indexing. With three new attributes in the \"Search Engine Optimization\" section of products, categories, and CMS pages, you can fine-tune your NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW, and NOARCHIVE tags page by page.\n\n### Page Builder Enhancements\n\nTwo powerful Page Builder enhancements from Mage-OS Lab are now part of Mage-OS 2:\n\n#### **Embedded Widgets**\n\n**Page Builder Widgets** adds \"CMS Widget\" support directly into Page Builder, including previews of the widget output. This can be used anywhere Page Builder is supported, including pages, blocks, and content descriptions.\n\n#### Import/Export and Remote Sync\n\n**PageBuilder Template Import/Export** enables Page Builder templates to be easily shared between Magento instances. This module supports both local file transfers and cloud-based Dropbox integration for template management workflows across multiple websites or instances.\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\nThe **Theme Optimization module** delivers better user experience based on the latest browser features:\n\n- **Back/Forward Cache (bfcache) support** gives almost instant browser navigation backwards/forwards on cacheable pages\n\n- **Speculative preloading** intelligently preloads links before the user clicks them\n\n- **Smooth page transitions** create a premium user experience\n\nAll of these combine to give a smoother experience and better Core Web Vitals than without.\n\n## Core Platform Improvements\n\nBeyond the new modules, Mage-OS 2.0 includes several important platform improvements developed by our community:\n\n### GitHub Pull Request Contributions\n\nSeveral key contributions from the community have been integrated:\n\n- **Admin Dashboard JavaScript Fix** (#164): Ryan Hoerr resolved a JavaScript error that could occur on admin login.​\n\n- **Config Load Safety Check** (#167): ProxiBlue added a config safety check to better handle missing config `id` values.​\n\n- **Configurable Product Export Fix** (#169): Ryan Hoerr fixed product export issues for configurable products with multiple super attributes.\n\n- ​**PHP 8.4 Compatibility** (#157): aelmizeb fixed PHP 8.4 deprecation errors on compilation.​\n\n- **USPS API Migration** (#170): We added Magento patch AC-15210 for support of the USPS REST API. USPS will be turning off the legacy Web Services API on January 26, 2026.\n\n## Celebrating Our Community\n\nMage-OS wouldn't exist without the support of our growing community.
